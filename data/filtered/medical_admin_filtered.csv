reddit,healthcareIT,"Comment on: Picking an EHR system? Avoid CPSI, imo.","Another example: CPSI uses something call Work Requests to address issues that don't have a simple workaround, the user can use until its working. These WRs sit for days to months before they are rolled out.

reddit,pharmacytechnician,Pt claims we’re “killing him”,"A few days ago, a regular came for his medication, so before I went up to help him, I checked to see if it was ready and was met with this eyesore of a message- “out-of-stock.” Fuck. Checked to see what med it was, Percocet 10 mg. Fuckkk. Mind you, it’s the weekend. At this point, I’m trying to figure out the best way to break the news to him.
