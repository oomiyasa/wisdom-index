reddit,salesforce,Comment on: Why are there so many awful Salesforce integrations?,"I shifted focus to primarily Mulesoft development when my last job acquired the platform and have been building primarily integrations and APIs for about 5 years now. What I’ve found is every 3rd party system has its own API interface, whether that is RESTful, SOAP, GraphQL, etc. And all of them have their own degree of quality, out of about 45-50 unique system integrations I’ve built, I’d say about 2 third party systems had a solid, reliable, and consistent API interface available.

I'm at a smaller company than I used to be at (\~700 employees), so less structure... wondering if others are experiencing these pains too and how you solved them. Here are the toughest parts for me: 1 - integrating real time data - HR is in their HRIS with actuals, Finance is in Anaplan, and the latest always needs to be exported. \- this inevitably affects capacity planning and forecasting in quarter too. It's never static in this case.
