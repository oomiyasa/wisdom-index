reddit,labrats,Comment on: MD Anderson clinical trials now halted under Trump admin. (At what point do we strike?),"I‚Äôm at a clinic with an ongoing NIH study, and for the moment all we know is that everything is contingent on an upcoming meeting between our PI and someone about something. Until that time everything is supposed to be paused, though the team is finagling workarounds. The communication block is such ass. Just sending this into the void because as others have pointed out there is like zero coverage of this. So can report that as it‚Äôs happening I give it 0/10, it sucks, very scary, do not recomme‚Ä¶",NikkieHyprogriff,89,https://reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1i9nckm/md_anderson_clinical_trials_now_halted_under/m93rdvu/,1737819708.0,0,reddit/comment/NikkieHyprogriff,https://reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1i9nckm/md_anderson_clinical_trials_now_halted_under/m93rdvu/,subreddit: labrats | parent: MD Anderson clinical trials now halted under Trump | score: 89 | tacit: True
reddit,labrats,Comment on: PCRs sometimes,"Just finishing up my bachelors and when my first PCR failed, my supervisor looked at me like I‚Äôm and idiot and I was so mortified that from that day on I keep a HANDWRITTEN checklist and say it out loud once I add each reagent and then tick it on my notebook üò≠üò≠ I probably look insane but this has never failed. With other methods I‚Äôm like ‚Äúdid I say that out loud or was that a memory from another day?‚Äù or ‚Äúdid I just move my tube ahead without adding the reagent?‚Äù üò≠",b_folklore,2,https://reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1m7eng5/pcrs_sometimes/n4ryk91/,1753301575.0,0,reddit/comment/b_folklore,https://reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1m7eng5/pcrs_sometimes/n4ryk91/,subreddit: labrats | parent: PCRs sometimes | score: 2 | tacit: True
reddit,qualityassurance,Help me with creating a list of what to learn for Automation,"The question gets asked many times every day and the answers are almost always the same generic responses. Learn Playwright. Learn Python. Learn {insert current popular tool and language}. Often you will see the link to that Github page that lists every possible tool QA tool that ever existed and people just tell them to learn that. I wanted to write something up and be a little more specific because if you've never programmed before, those answers, while helpful, can be pretty overwhelming.

reddit,qualityassurance,Comment on: QA doesn‚Äôt feel like QA anymore,"It's just a job man. I hear you, but at the end of the day I'm not going to try and push back against product and managers when they refuse to budge. Not worth my energy or time. If there are any risks or issues I will document them early and refer to them when things blow up. I will definitely go through the checklist because that's what my manager is asking for and that's how I get paid. Not much deep thinking. But for me that's ok, it's just a job.",polohatty,46,https://reddit.com/r/QualityAssurance/comments/1mn5wf2/qa_doesnt_feel_like_qa_anymore/n82ka9d/,1754895278.0,0,reddit/comment/polohatty,https://reddit.com/r/QualityAssurance/comments/1mn5wf2/qa_doesnt_feel_like_qa_anymore/n82ka9d/,subreddit: qualityassurance | parent: QA doesn‚Äôt feel like QA anymore | score: 46 | tacit: True
