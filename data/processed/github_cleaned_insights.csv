"> Attach files that are being edited to the context of the conversation, WITHOUT truncation. This I don't believe is the right approach. My philosophy is that the agent should decide which context is relevant and load it. We should not fill it up with potentially junk tokens (although persisting more verbatim context as part of the summarization process is still something I'd like to do, it just never worked well in testing...) > Copilot should have the model rebuild some of its context before …",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2025-08-06,github/roblourens,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/260188#issuecomment-3161883919,repo: microsoft/vscode | issue: Copilot Chat: chat summarization makes broken and bad edits | keyword: checklist
"As a stop gap we've setup an in-house webserver and hosted all extensions there. It also exposed an API endpoint to return latest number version for a given extension. Then for every extension we had a timer to ping service every minute, check the version and compare with the one installed. So if a new version was detected it would prompt to upgrade and then from the it was just a bunch of chained promises (show a prompt, on OK download an extension, show a prompt to restart, restart). Then the…",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2018-03-21,github/levonmamikonyan,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/21839#issuecomment-375047098,repo: microsoft/vscode | issue: Feature Request: Support for private marketplace/gallery | keyword: gotcha
"Having users on my team accidentally edit something because it's json and everywhere else we're editing files by hand, except this 1 or 2 files that are generated as part of the build is very bad. It would be valuable to be able to hide these files. The work around is of course to place the files in specific folders, that the exclude pattern doesn't match, but that's not always possible, or smart. Is there anywhere I can go to cast my (+1) vote for this as a valuable feature? txs, Alan",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2017-02-02,github/goblinfactory,https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/869#issuecomment-277089044,repo: microsoft/vscode | issue: Exclude all files except for... | keyword: gotcha
