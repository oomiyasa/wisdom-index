"Managing projects feels like solving a complex puzzle with pieces that keep shifting. Poor communication and unclear handoffs cause delivery failures without a centralized system. When agencies lack clear visibility, they waste hours in status meetings instead of doing the real work. In short, disorganized project management drains productivity. But agencies can change that. The first steps on how to organize projects involve understanding your current chaos and gradually introducing structure. ...",,,,,,Anecdotal,pattern,,,,,,,,2025-08-19,devto/projectmanagement,https://dev.to/hardikbhawsar/how-to-organize-projects-in-marketing-agencies-that-handle-multiple-clients-1f3a,"Tag: projectmanagement, Reactions: 0, Title: How to Organize Projects in Marketing Agencies That Handle Multiple Clients"

"My First EC2 Project: Hosting a Website on AWS as a Beginner As someone new to cloud computing, I recently took on the challenge of hosting my first website using Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). This project was a hands-on introduction to deploying a web server in the cloud, and it gave me a solid foundation in AWS infrastructure. Here's how I did it—and how you can too. What Is EC2? Amazon EC2 is a service that lets you rent virtual servers in the cloud.

"I learned something powerful about leadership last year. I never told my team what to do first. We were stuck on a project that seemed impossible to finish. Instead of jumping in with solutions, I sat down with each team member. I asked what support they needed and what barriers they faced. Then I spent my time removing those obstacles for them. Our productivity increased by 60% in just two months. Great leaders don't create followers. They make more leaders.

"As a community manager, one of the hardest parts of my job has always been creating content that’s both accurate and genuinely human-sounding. It’s easy to make something factual. It’s easy to make something “AI-generated.” But getting something that feels real and connects with people? That’s a whole different game. I used to spend hours rewriting drafts, fact-checking, and trying to strip out that “robot voice” AI tools often have. That changed when I started using SmythOS.

"By Konstantin, co-founder at Vaiz Ask any growing team how they manage projects, and you’ll hear a familiar story: > “We have a tool for tasks, another for docs, something else for reporting… and then Slack to hold it all together.” Somewhere along the way, the promise of “one platform to manage your work” turned into juggling five different ones. Tools got smarter on paper — but heavier in practice. Instead of focusing on their product or clients, teams are stuck maintaining their setup.
