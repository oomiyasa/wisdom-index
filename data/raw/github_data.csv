"You forgot to mention consultant compensation. When I first started at a boutique energy consulting firm in Houston, that has a reputation for high compensation levels, all the new hires were always talking about what part of town they were buying a house in. Fast forward 8 years, and new hires are all talking about how many roommates they have and whether or not they live at home with their parents. In just 8 years the people at this firm went from being well paid to needing roommates. If being on the road full time and billing 50+ hours per week isn't enough to at least fucking live by yourself, **then what is the point of this bullshit?** Meanwhile, while these new hires are killing themselves in order to appease their masters who gaze down upon them from their ivory towers, those masters (partners) are all bringing 7 figures. Someone **please** make that make sense for me. We've got people who spend less time engaging with clients in a year than the consultants do every single week, and they're making over 10 times what the people who actually do the work that actually brings in the money make. This wouldn't be a problem if the people at the bottom were still driving new BMWs and buying houses, but they aren't. They're living at home with their parents because they can't even afford an apartment. The money to properly compensate consultants exists. There's plenty of it.

While I learned a ton, my ""hands on keyboard"" experience was limited. I felt like I was just doing check the box exercises that required no critical thinking. But the work load was relentless--meetings for 6-8 hours a day and I was exhausted afterwards and expected to do it again and again and again. No time to prepare within a reasonable work schedule. My colleagues all worked in Atlanta, about 10 hours away. They all knew each other and I was the only person on the project anywhere near the client. I asked to go down there to meet them and work for a week, but it was shot down. There were no perks other than shopping discounts, points given to employees to spend on shopping, and free Udemy training. I didn't see the point.

"Agreee and I will add another that relates to 4) 5) Outsourcing to low tier countries, low quality workers. Outsourcing of work that used to be done by juniors to lower cost regions erodes learning opportunities. It also tends to produce very low quality work. It understandably pisses people off when they have to fix low quality work. It also erodes morale and motivation. A key aspect of consulting used to be that you work with very smart colleagues who make you better every day at your job. When that isn't the case, and you're forced to deal with low quality people, it's fair to question why you bothered to bust your ass to get a job to work alongside those people.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-08-14,u/Additional-Tax-5643,https://reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1es6396/why_are_so_many_young_people_leaving_the/li4bqth/,post: Why are so many young people leaving the profession?

"I’ve been a consultant in the Big4 for approaching 9 years now - client facing role that also folds in finance, modelling, and data engineering capability. I agree with a lot of this, and it’s quite sensitively articulated, but I would swap out point 3 entirely, for something else. Partner ‘disillusionment’. Modern young professionals are less likely to sip on the firm’s KoolAid, and partners don’t luxuriate in the same respect and admiration that they used to. I think younger employees are cynical, spot partners who don’t know what they’re talking about much more easily. With a small number of notable exceptions, partners gracefully float into engagements at critical junctures to be present at key meetings and enjoy getting plenty of credit and adulation, but ultimately they do extremely little except slap their name on the output of people who are simultaneously more talented, and more junior than them. Almost everyone I work with has come to the joint conclusion that the level of talent peaks in the middle ranks of the organisation.

"One more to add: There’s a much greater feeling of instability as firms are more and more reactive to market conditions with layoffs always looming, most projects having to offshore half the work in order to price competitively, and just general anxiety when you’re on the bench.

"I run a niche consulting firm and when recruiting, I tell people consulting is not for everyone. The pressure of multiple clients, stakeholders and being expected to work harder and be smarter than most of the client’s employees is a lot of demand.

Hilarious! Two sides and all that. Internal client side - formatting will never matter and we make fun of people who are anal about it. Typically ex-B4 people who are our VP’s; so it gives us a reason to poke our bosses. Consulting side - formatting is trust. If your paying me for advice and i give you great advice but you need a cypher to understand it - you aren’t paying me. You are young. Learn this lesson early; make your boss happy and fuck your personal opinion. Stop putting in 14 hour days if the content matters less than the formatting.

"There’s always someone above you, no matter where you are on the ladder. I recently had an interview with the CEO of a major company for a Head of Strategy position, and I was surprised by his level of frustration. Even though he was the top leader in the local office, he had to seek approval from the parent company abroad, which acts as the main stakeholder, for almost every decision, no matter how small. It really surprise me how, despite his significant authority, his decision-making power was quite limited.

"Yeah big4 in france almost all added a non-equity Partner title (which maies no sense because to technically be a Partner, you should have equity lol). The salary range you mention is similar for Director and early non-equity Partners here as well. Not sure why everybody is shocked in this thread, this is the kind of money you make outside of tech / strategy consulting / IB / VC / PE and it’s still outrageously high compared to the medium wage in europe. I do agree that I thought we would be making big bucks out of non strategy consulting even at Director level, but it’s gone downhill over the years (or more like inflation caught up and salaries remained the same). It’s incredibly frustrating, especially when you look at your peers in the US racking up 2-x times more for pretty much the same job.

"Haven't you always known it's a pyramid scheme, and there is always another layer. We set the juniors billable targets which equate to billing 5-8x what we pay them. Basically people do work and the majority of the output gets sucked up the pyramid. When you get into a sales role, you are now selling and delivering, competing the whole process, and yet the majority of that is going to neither the person doing all the pre-sale not post-sale work. Yes, there has been trend to non equity partners, such that you are a junior partner building the business, but the value gets sucked away from you. Wait till you put your few years in and discover much to your dismay that there is a shadow pyramid within partnership. You've made equity partner, are making a team of 25 bill 6x their salary or more, but yet a miniscule fraction of the 150 salaries billing you are overseeing goes to you.

">Am I right in feeling pretty underwhelmed about all of this? Well, do you have what it takes to be an Equity Partner? According to your firm, the answer is No. No one here knows your skill set, including office-politics skills and business skills in addition to accounting skills. Have there been discussions about getting to EP and what were the goals to get to EP? If so, did you meet those goals? And is 170k comparable to other NEPs in your geography and line of business?

I use some of those shortcuts but many other Ctrl+shift+g = ungroup Ctrl+g = group Ctrl+h = search + replace Ctrl+f = search And many more I just know when sitting on the keyboard. But the absolute game changer that made me insanely efficient is the quick access toolbar AND (please hold your breath) The bkt-toolbox - it gives you three more tabs with and infinite offering of functions like margins- alignment - same shape selection - mass font update etc. Some acquaintances of an acquaintance of mine developed it. All of the functions can be added to the quick access toolbar. You guys would be so jealous seeing what I can do with it.

"I attended an undergrad recruiting event in NYC for Strategy&. They had about 10 people representing the company, and only 2 were women (one woman was from the People team). During Q&A, I pointed out the imbalance of men and women and asked what it's like to work at the company as a woman.

"MBB and Big4 are constantly in the news for messing up. Honestly, as the client - regulators see it as your responsibility to get the work done. Consulting contracts have clauses, insurances, liability limitations, exclusions, indemnities, just to protect from these instances. Factors that impact this; not excuses, factors for consideration: Citi’s failings: 1. Procurement of the services - big ticket consulting services procurement tends to be backed by leadership and they cut off the procurement function’s legs in some instances. So these processes can sometimes tend to lack the required rigour/ due diligence. 2. Review and assurance of deliverables - any project has regular touch-points, review of documentation which eventually needs to be signed off. Other considerations: 3. Blame the consultant culture - always easy to blame the consultant. There could have been underlying issues with Citi that the consultants tried and failed to fix.

"Clients can't just go buy an AI ""thing"", plug it in and start firing people - including consultants. Management consulting may be in transition, on that we agree. But clients still need help. Remember there are three reasons a company hires a consulting firm: 1. They don't have the expertise. 2. They don't have the capacity. 3. An outside force tells them they have to (e.g., an audit). There are a host of questions just around AI that many clients are not equipped to answer. There will still be work out there. KPMG didn't *always* do ERP implementations. KPMG's main issue at the minute is that they hired too many people during the pandemic in response to demand that couldn't be sustained.

"Nah. AI is a disruptive force, and many firms and functions will disappear, but it does not at all mean that consulting itself disappears, nor that the partnership model disappears. Consulting fills the spaces around the lifecycle changes that occur in human organizations. Consulting is human experiential guidance for these transitions. Coaching plus ""implementation."" That continues to exist. Even with agents doing the work, and some model providing global expertise, decisions are local. The human director has to set and monitor success criteria and cost. The partner billing model is leverage plus risk management. Seniors leverage juniors- older humans vs younger humans- this continues to exist. And all categories of business risk still exist, from juniors making mistakes to clients unable to pay to wider business and sector disruptions. AI makes all moats shallow. Risk dimensions only go up with the augmentation that comes from AI. The only way consulting disappears is if work disappears.

"I agree for the most part. The entire consulting model is definitely changing although I think the value of AI is tremendously overstated for everything but speeding up research. Lots of companies are pursuing it just because it’s the “next big thing”. Regardless here’s how I see things going 1. The bottom of the pyramid - analysts/entry consultants - will be moved offshore or minimized. Firms will employ graphic designers to build decks for a fraction of the price that the consulting team bills. This work provides little to no direct value to a client and the research they do CAN be tremendously streamlined with AI. 2. Clients are increasingly demanding to have consultants with actual industry experience staffed on projects rather than fresh grads. Let’s be honest, selling a project based on past performance and then sending in a team of green newbies who are really only experienced as Excel monkeys good at building pretty slides has always been a giant fucking joke. Clients see through this charade now because lots of them participated in the joke. Consulting is going to become something you go into after a decently long career in industry - as it should have always been. 3. This new model is going to reduce profits because the more experienced consultants will cost more AND refuse to work the insane “free” hours the newbies put up with. Hence the ability to support a massive partner overhead will decrease. 4. We’ll see a move towards more non-equity managing director type roles that are entirely focused on sales and client management. Partners will be fewer and more aligned toward strategy over an entire industry vertical. Big firms could end up with only a couple dozen partners with a whole lot of sales guys under them.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-12-23,u/Ihitadinger,https://reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1hkejr4/the_downfall_of_consulting_partners/m3efn55/,post: The Downfall of Consulting Partners

"Title of this post is attention grabbing and very misleading as there is no downfall of consulting partners just because one KPMG partner, the “lifeblood of the firm” is “finally leaving” after 25 years. LOL. Bro what the f are you talking about This partner in question was probably fired for not selling enough / understanding AI / data analytics capabilities for strategy and M&A deals. If Partners show resistance to adopt newest capabilities developed at firm, and don’t find a way to integrate and sell those capabilities, will be let go. While KPMG was founded in 1987, the “M” in KPMG has been around since 1895, and “P” goes back to 1870 I believe. It has been through both world wars advising governments and 5 monarchs. With each industrial revolution, it finds a way to evolve and use latest technology as an enabler to transform businesses and finance functions. Evolution and change is good for the firm and rest of the industry. If the firm (Partners who came before us) did NOT evolve from using pen and paper, to calculators, to spreadsheets, to Alteryx / Tableau / PowerBI, to ChatGPT and beyond - there would be no Big4 or Consulting Services industry. With each disruptive change over the last 150 years, of course the Partners had to completely reimagine business models (duh!)… clearly this didn’t lead to “way less of a need for partners” as OP suggests. In fact, we have more partners today than we had ever before, and more will be promoted in the future as business models evolve. To the college students/ grads reading this, don’t let the title of this post and other nonsense on Reddit steer you away from Consulting. Take electives in analytics / AI / learn Python for Finance.

"ERP isn't at risk until you get accuracy, reliability, traceability, and predictable testing issues with AI. You're talking about core business operations and all kinds of legal/regulatory compliance issues with ERP and related software. AI is a tool to help implementation staff at this point, not replace. I'd also disagree with centralization and offshoring as a fix-all, though repetitive tasks will certainly continue to be relocated to cheap centralized areas. And, of course, that's where customers would even accept such a thing.

"This is surprising, and contradicts Financial Times recent news detailing KPMG’s high growth (>5%) for the fiscal year. The threat of AI is overblown here and even at Bain where we partner with Microsoft directly and have access to Open AI, nothing substantial is happening that will drastically eliminate the bottom layers at this juncture. AI agents with the degree of accuracy, autonomy and access to localized data are years away from realization and it is cheaper to get analysts on board, especially from emerging markets.

That’s a standard policy - you have to retain final documents to clients but not the drafts. So it comes down to whether actually deleted anything he shouldn’t have (how do you proof that??). Then there is a lot of whining how he was fired, which is weird, he probably signed something somewhere that the partnership could fire him at any time. Then comes the defamation claims - which seem to me to hinge on the paper deletion claim? If he didn’t do anything, they defamed him I guess? I am not a lawyer but I truly slept in a holiday in this week. Seems if there is proof he deleted something, he is in trouble and this will end badly for him. If there is not, it comes down to how defamation is defined.

So at the start of each week, you can just have everyone reconfirm commitment to their week’s deadlines and adjust ahead of time anywhere they foresee issues.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-08-13,u/pineapplepredator,https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1erckmr/how_i_feel_every_day_of_my_life/lhxyki6/,post: How I feel every day of my life
I don’t mind giving updates during scheduled status calls. It’s the constant ask for them that I can’t stand and will not contribute to. Even more frustrating is a stakeholder/manager asking for an update right after the status call where I just gave said update.,,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-08-13,u/ind3pend0nt,https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1erckmr/how_i_feel_every_day_of_my_life/lhz2jv8/,post: How I feel every day of my life

"A project management style that I find frustrating and inefficient is when the PM pops in once a week for “updates” that they expect to be in their standard format. List of tasks, status and risk on each, estimated dates, earned value, ETC etc. A for more effective style is for the PM to be part of the team and organically learn the status of these tasks, hearing them in the language of the do-er. Hear the lead say that they had the order wrong and need to change plan. Notice that too many juniors are not understanding and therefore more senior leadership is required. It’s the project managers job to understand the language of the do-ers and understand the true status of the work. It’s not the delivery teams job to translate it upwards. This of course requires the Project Manager to have a good degree of technical familiarity with the work. I think this should be expected in modern, complex projects. The result is that the PM can fill in 80% of the status themselves without calling a meeting because they’re already aware of what’s going on by having good relationships with the team and listening in to their existing conversations",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-08-14,u/Soliloquy86,https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1erckmr/how_i_feel_every_day_of_my_life/lhzweco/,post: How I feel every day of my life

"Allow me to present an alternative. PMP can be really useful as a framework for how to think about projects — not necessarily a step by step methodology — for those newer to management. It’s like algebra. In my case, for example, I was coming out of the military as an NCO (enlisted management, not an officer), with almost zero formalized leadership training. The traditional way we make managers is “this guy is good at his job so let’s put him in charge”. Getting my PMP was a major part of how I learned to manage teams and projects in a purposeful and meaningful way, and for someone new to civilian leadership, it was *one part* of the process but was an important part for me.

"All the PMP makes you is certified. If you're relying on the PMBOK Guide to help you know how to handle every situation that might come you're way, your expectations are the problem. Send a relatively inexperienced project manager to CSM training and then put them in charge of an upgrade and migration of SAP CRM to HANA across four international offices of a global company. In this case, scrum would be useless and common sense would not be enough. Not understanding the work to be done, the best approaches to complete the work, the team flow, or culture of the company significantly increases the risk of failure. I would consider a project manager that lacks this understanding to be either inexperienced or naive. I would consider someone a bad project manager if they were adamant that there was only one way to get s(tuff) done and continued to force that approach in spite of continued failures, blaming everyone else for the failures. So, yes, if you were a PMP and repeatedly tried, and failed, to do everything in the PMBOK Guide on every project, that would qualify you for the designation ""bad"" project manager. I would say the same of any certification. Unlike the Scrum Guide, the PMBOK Guide does not claim to be immutable, and it actually recognizes that not everything in it applies in all situations.

If being a good PM was just about being able to follow along with the body of knowledge, then the 3 years of experience wouldn’t be a factor for sitting for the PMP. It is about knowing which tools to use and when. Scrum, agile, waterfall, etc are all in the PMBOK. But you aren’t going to use them all at once.

I'm a senior PM in an IT company working mainly on internal projects with inhouse developers and its quite the opposite. My 40 hours of home office are usually 25 - 30 hours and work still gets done. I usually only focus on impactful tasks and ignore some of the lower priority tasks until they become irrelevant or high priority. I take 1h breaks in between meetings quite often. Sometimes I jiggle my mouse while playing video games to keep the 'online' status. Or I wiggle the mouse while cooking or cleaning. I fill my calendar with tasks that sound good and fill up half of my day with things that take an actual hour to complete. Basically mastered the art of looking busy. Some of my coworkers seem to do the same thing and we kinda have this mutual understanding to do important stuff first and then just pretend to be busy for the rest of the day. Its honestly as relaxed as it can be. Been doing this since start of COVID and my performance reviews are better than ever cause the boss only see the impactful things we do and noticed how happy the team seems.

I’m pretty sure that the % ProjM burnout has always been this high and higher from the very first measurements started decades ago. Probably doesn’t surprise anyone who has been in the role but is probably a bit of a shock to many new people in the role since we are again in the point of the cycle where demand for the role is increasing as companies swing back to consolidating multiple roles under the ‘Proj Mgr’ job listings under the familiar illusion that there will be cost and complexity savings. Keep in mind that many leaders / companies have determined that this is the acceptable cost for being given the sense (though not realistic) of control on endeavors with the ability to transfer risk to single-throats-to-choke. The good news is that there are many seasoned people who can help with calming this ever-present indicator and reminding others what the reality is and how to move forward through it…or not play into it.,,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-08-02,u/SpaceDoink,https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1ei9pq0/thought_this_was_interesting/lg5g440/,post: Thought this was interesting

It is now about rote learning and checking boxes. There is not a whiff of leadership training or understanding in it.

I put in 120bto 140 hrs of study. Memorization etc.. This was in 2015. Passing that exam was a major change of my life and career direction. That cert let me get my foot in the door for the PM field in pharma. Only about 2% do I really use these days and that is just terminology. I came from a pharma QA bkgd do concepts were same terminology different but to me it was all the same logic. I leveraged a lot of QA work to qualify as a PM I was so stressed out before the test. I found out right after I took the test if I passed on the computer screen. I changed my answers a few times after re evaluating my answer and think that made a difference in me passing It was a major major relief that I passed .

"I believe the exam’s focus on behavioral questions is intentional. As routine work becomes automated, soft skills will likely become the key differentiator for PMs. Behavioral questions can be harder to prepare for than math or process-based ones because they require deeper self-awareness and experience. The OP may have underestimated the role their soft skills played in passing the exam.

"Nah, the real value is being the connector of a project or a team. Making sure the right people are invited ensures you and the team get what you need.

"For the use cases you outline you are correct. Project managers are not admins. The only meeting you should “facilitate” are your own. And, in that case, of course, you’re not facilitating.

"Stop having meetings. No really. Just stop. I consult people and organizations on how to do this all the time. I will drop into a PM's calendar and find double and triple-booked meetings on their calendar. Some are over 120% occupied with just meetings if you count the double and triple bookings. Few, if any of these are value-added. Here's some strategies. you can DM me if you want something more in-depth or personal. * You accept meetings from other departments - often without agendas and they clog your calendars. If it isn't important enough to have an agenda, with minutes and actions that you can review, you don't need to be on it * Daily standups are almost always a waste. Your team's work packets should be in a ticketing system, board, or on slack or teams. * I have never in my life seen your scenario where someone wants me to create a meeting on their behalf so that they could run it. That sounds like an admin or PC's function. What are the purposes of these calls? Do they even need to happen? * Status readout meetings are a waste. These can just be an email, or you can direct the stakeholder to some sort of read-only form of the project plan I only meet as a PM on a biweekly basis to discuss risk, or high-level comings and goings with the program as a whole. The audience is mostly leadership and I keep things general for that reason I meet ad-hoc if something can't be solved in a few Teams chats. If I need to organize a call, its a quick 15-20 min session, with an agenda and a limited audience If the customer insists on meeting all the time, I wean this back by delivering them a project readout, and then slowly over time, shrinking the time slot and frequency of the meeting so we can just discuss risks and down-range optics.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-08-01,u/NotMyPibble,https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1ehpo4c/i_hate_meeting_facilitation_with_a_passion/lg11a64/,post: I hate meeting facilitation with a passion.

With how much they have changed the PMP in recent years, they should make everyone who earned theirs over 5 years ago test again to keep it. PMPs from 10 years ago don’t need any understanding of Agile or any of the advancements in the profession. The knowledge base of PMPs in the current body of knowledge is all over the place. Also kind of weird for them to have an “exclusive area for PMPs when probably 90% of people there are already PMPs….. PMI Infinity is interesting but not revolutionary. Also, it’s basically a mandatory tool for PMI. It’s needed to make sure ChatGPT and others don’t become the go-to for project managers, potentially wreaking havoc on the quality of guidance PMs are getting through those tools.

The VP of my division said something to that effect recently 2-3 months before cuts were made and that solved so many issues by setting expectations for the inevitable which softened the blow to employee morale and proactively prevented gossip, etc. This way no one is truly surprised when it's time to have the conversation and if the client pivots again there's less fire fighting you need to do.

"I like the professionalism of PMs when scheduling meetings relevant to the project. Most people include the wrong stakeholders, don’t title the meetings properly, don’t have an agenda in the invite, don’t take minutes, don’t prepare ahead of time. If a meeting is scheduled by a PM I know we’re going to have driven, intentional conversations with risks discussed, action items assigned to owners and things documented and folllowed up on. That isn’t admin work - that’s the beauty of the PM skillset: it’s intentional activity to ensure delivery is on time. Most businesses and IT departments waste so much time deviating from topics, schedule unstructured meetings, forget to take notes, never assign ownership and accountability to action items.

I was too busy and too broke to feel happy. All I did in my free time was eat and sleep. Since leaving academia, things have looked SO different. I have my evenings and weekends back now, for one thing. I also make enough money to treat myself in my free time. As much as I loved education from the perspective of working with students (I was a teacher for some years before I got tugged into the project manager side of things), I couldn't survive it after all.

"Honestly, I feel like every PM relates to your ending comment about going to work at McDonalds or something - I told someone yesterday I was gonna move to the woods and be a goosefarmer or something, which in hindsight, is a terrible idea - geese are MEAN. :) Timeblocking and breaking things into specific focus times are going to be key. I start my day with a bit of time planning, and ask myself these questions: 1. what are the THREE things I need to accomplish today? (no more than 3) 2. what is the priority/urgency of these items (so I can stack rank them) Then, I start with the most urgent thing. That way, I can get at least ONE THING done for the day (I need to be able to say I did something for my sanity). I know a few folks said something about a project management tool - Trello is like a gateway into PM tools, in my opinion - it's nice, but doesn't roll up larger amounts of data. I like using a tool like ClickUp, where I can have a List for each project, and have all tasks/documentation inside that List, with assignees/prioritization, and then it rolls up so I can get a view of ALL my projects, and filter for tasks that are the most urgent or see all the work that is the responsibility of a particular person. That also helps a ton because there was another person who commented about a Slack channel for everyone to be part of to get the updates - that is also really helpful to have all those documented just so later you can say SEE IT'S ALL HERE but also folks can async review it so you're not all spending most of your time in meetings.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-05-03,u/bproductive,https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1cjb3q0/how_do_people_stay_on_top_of_projects/l2gotpc/,post: How do people stay on top of projects?!

"6 year PM here with about 25 projects at a time. We started implementing “focus days” at work about two years ago and it has done wonders for everyone’s productivity. No meetings, no slacks etc. You may not be able to do this for your team, but try doing that for yourself - Set aside one day a week for no meetings. You’ll see a major improvement in your productivity and stream of thought! My other suggestion is building in “debrief time” after big and even small meetings to put everything into your PM software while it’s still fresh in your mind. Lastly, group meeting together. All in the morning or al in the afternoon.

"I have a paper notebook. I write down what I need to get done and prioritise it. I use an absolute ton of bespoke excel tools to translate the data I receive to what my teams, management, and customers want. This automation saves much time. I empower my technical leads to make their own technical decisions within the project time/cost/quality boundaries. I make them own the wbs, the dates, and budget. I schedule regular meetings with my technical teams and use the same rolling agenda. We go through the previous meeting notes and spend on a shared screen, then this week's. This ensures nothing gets lost or festers. I give really clear instructions. It also massively reduces ad hoc meetings. I make friends with the client. Bad clients will ruin your life. I prioritise risks before they happen, so they never become issues. Logically thinking, risks happening are the only way projects go wrong.

"Cog Psych Major / PMP here. Thirty years of watching organizations rediscover the fundamental principles of project management, due to the same emotional and social defects that created the same failures that originated the need for project management in the first place. For example, we had a project with no ""Point of Contact"" column, just a ""Responsible Office"" column. I told leadership that if we don't identify who's responsible for delivery, you've handed everyone an ironclad excuse to deliver nothing (""we reorganized/rescoped/my job responsibilities changed/we never signed an MoA""). They told me to shut up. Check. No one delivered anything. Your tax dollars at work. There's also the unspoken personal incentives and rationalizations to underestimate costs and schedule and overestimate earned value. I canceled a project because I was unwilling to underestimate the cost. If I ***had*** underestimated the cost, leadership would have funded it, I would have delivered late and over budget, claimed the expensive bottom-line cost of the project as ""generated value"" on my resume, and no one would be the wiser. Instead, I canned it, pissed off my bosses and saved the taxpayers $1.5M.

"At my old job, we used to joke we were part-time managers and full-time therapists. At my new job, I rarely have to deal with emotional problems, and more have to deal with people pushing themselves too hard they’ll burn out. While I think personality has much to do with it, office culture also plays a huge role. How the upper management sets expectations for the whole company can affect how people behave. In organizations where there isn’t a lot of clarity in future and current role responsibilities, I’ve seen people feel more depressed and disengaged. In organizations with aggressive upper management that acts extremely punitive, there’s an attitude of fear and overexertion. In project management, we must understand both sides - our executive expectations and their effect on our team and, at the same time, our team's general disposition and how these upper management attitudes could affect them. It’s not easy, and I don’t know if a simple trick or data set can explain the human condition. Myers Briggs and other personality tests can be helpful but should be taken with a grain of salt. There’s no substitute for actually getting to know people. I’ve started listening to the book “Surrounded by Idiots,” which, despite its title, is more about why we perceive people as “idiots” when they aren’t.

"I agree that the psychological aspects of project management are important and not widely appreciated. Most aspects of it are at least partially researched and/or documented under a general academic heading of Industrial Psychology, which is covered to varying degress in professional HR qualification courses (one of which I studied many years ago). The big gap in the research has always been the psychology of incompetence. We can all understand someone who turns out to be no good at something and moves on, but what about the people who make a career out of it? They get appointed and can't really do their job properly but somehow get promoted out of it into another role that they are no good at, ad infinitum.

"Absolutely agreed. I'd argue these concepts are at least as important as the people, process, and technical skills involved in project management. I was recently in a course about engagement. It was all about the psychology and connecting with your audience, speaking and otherwise. I took communication classes in college, and had so many speaking and communication skills courses and seminars over nearly three decades. I learned more in this two-day training course, than I did in college plus 27 years of professional development. Most of us look at connecting with our co-workers and organizations with the wrong perspective. You need to dig down to the motivation of people and approach one another with empathy and understanding. You need own and cater to your strengths, and realize your weaknesses - build them up if possible. Set and communicate personal boundaries, while respecting those of others...

"Couldn't agree more. It can be a very mentally demanding job that's reliant on others to perform to hit deadlines. The biggest thing, for me personally, is the need to be on the front foot at all times. Issues happen, timelines can slip, unforseen complexity etc can arise, but how you manage that messaging and the perception others have of you is the difference between people thinking you're in control or not. For me, ensuring I don't miss a beat and I'm in a position to manage the perception and messaging of issues as they arise can take it's toll some days / weeks, especially when it seems you're fighting one fire after the next. Lastly, projects can be anything between a few months and a good number of years. I've found the stress of a project can definitely demish over time as your team is moulded more in your vision of how you need them to work, but in the project world, you don't always have the benefit of having the same team for years (or decades) on end like you might in BAU/operational teams, and, whilst there might be some people you can work with again, you often have to restart that process for each new project.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-08-09,u/cousinrayray,https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1enuzvq/i_think_we_need_to_talk_more_about_psychological/lhaluuf/,post: I think we need to talk more about psychological factors in project management in a clear systematic way.

"Never assume it's absolutely mandated to have daily standups. - Standups aren't mandated - Daily isn't mandated - Not everyone needs to be there if there is one - There are other ways to share information and some of them may well be better-suited to your team One of the things which gave me the absolute [redacted by professional-language-bot] about some jobs I've been in was the zombie mantra of daily standups where, day after day, no-one has anything actually useful to contribute, or anything that genuinely needed multi-person participation, but we still all had to be repeatedly torn away from our work so someone could be utterly useless at us. If your meeting could be an email, Slack update, or online discussion, don't make people have to all be in the same place at the same time. Meetings - and yes that absolutely does include standups - should only ever be ad-hoc, and only ever when there is a genuine need for people to physically be in the same room or, even online, all team members have to stop working because some piece of information is just so darn gosh-darn Criticalll! that the building will literally catch on fire if it's not disseminated immediately (and you don't have standard real-time channels like text chat, for some reason).

"I'm not OP, but I do have my CSM -- my Agile certs are all from Scrum Alliance, though I don't think it matters which company you go through. CSM is a two-day class followed by an online exam. It's good for two years before you have to renew, unlike the PMI equivalent that's only good for one, so that's a plus. It's a great introduction to Agile and Scrum if you're not familiar with them, and it'll look good on your resume if you're applying to jobs that want you to be familiar with Agile. Personally, I'm happy to have gone through the class since I'm in a company that uses Scrum, and I definitely learned from it, but my company paid for the training. Like any cert, it only has as much value as employers place on it. Some hiring managers will be glad to see you have it, others won't care at all. If most of the jobs you're interested in are asking for Agile or Scrum certifications, it's probably worth it to you.

People keep saying the PMP is more valuable than a degree. I know a lot of people that hold a PMP and they're terrible PMs. Others have no certification and they're excellent at the job.

"I mean if you're going to get a cert, PMP is probably the one (in NA at least to get). On job postings I see a few where it will say PMP is a requirement but most have it as a 'nice to have'. I have my PMP. Did I learn anything from it? I don't think so. The good PMs are people that have the type of skills that can't be taught in a book or through applying a process or methodology to it. The people who aren't good PMs are the people like OP that prefer to talk about the importance of the certs they have and the methodologies as opposed to their actual experience and skill-set they possess, irrespective of their PMI exposure. If I'm hiring a PM, I'm looking at experience. Someone with 10 years relevant experience and no PMP is getting an interview over someone with less experience or less relevant experience but have their PMP. If you're missing out on jobs from not having a PMP cert then you probably dodged a bullet. Also, and I say this semi-sarcastically, if you value PMP.... write it on your resume.

"One of the most important things you’ll learn as a PM is how to hold your stakeholders accountable. You must not take ownership of problems or risks that are outside your control or authority. As the PM you are not accountable for delivering the project yourself; your job is to manage the delivery process. This means ensuring that the right people have the right information to make informed decisions. Example: When communicating risks, make sure it’s clear why the accountable person should care. Saying something like *'We can’t complete testing because of insufficient resources'* sounds like your problem. But if you reframe it as *'Gaps in testing due to insufficient resources could lead to financial/operational/reputational issues that won’t be noticed until after Go Live'*, it becomes a problem for the sponsor or stakeholder. Also, let them know what you’re doing in the meantime. For example, *'We’ll continue at risk, which could impact quality or delay the schedule.'* This puts the decision-making in their hands and makes it clear that the consequences of inaction are on them. It forces stakeholders to either make a decision or accept the risk, but it shows you’re still in control of managing the project.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-09-10,u/GaryLifts,https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1fcvq6c/experienced_project_managers_if_you_could_give/lmeb5gs/,"post: Experienced Project Managers: If you could give advice to your younger self, what would it be?"

"Hey - completely understand your frustration and I hear you. One thing to point out is that, as a PM, you are responsible and in some cases accountable for the project as a whole.

Therefore, you’re in the right place to direct ‘blame’ so to speak.

"I've been an IT infrastructure specialist for last 22 years, and I was in the very same boat that you're in now and I even threw imposter syndrome in the mix as well. I'm now at a level of where I'm consulted at Federal and State government departments and private sector industries levels. Every non-technical PM goes through this, but I will lament a number of people's comments in this thread. As the PM you're not responsible for the technical delivery of the project, that is your tech lead. What you're responsible for is the quality of the technical deliverable. You don't need to know the ins and outs of the technology that you're delivering. When I started IT project management I had no IT background (unless you call being a closet geek one) but I relied on those people around me to assist. I asked questions on technology that I didn't understand and seek advice from the appropriate resources. What you need to really understand is the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and network topology to have a very solid foundation in IT. It gave me the conceptual basis of working in IT. What I would suggest is seeking out a technical mentor who can help you with questions but I would also suggest that any project that you're working on do a bit of your own study as there is only so much you can learn by osmosis when being a project manager. You do need to put in effort in to extend your knowledge and experience.

"I think there are two things at play here. 1. The IT sector is a highly technical field and unfortunately seams to attract this type that looks down on people they see as less capable than them. Simply put, IT personal, generally speaking, think they’re smarter than everyone else. Coupled with a lack of consideration that comes along with having a preoccupation with social decorum, they can easily make others feel small. Obviously, this is a generalisation and kind of a stereotype but in my personal experience, it does seem to play out this way. 2. You’re undervaluing your skill set. Please understand this; most people don’t understand the value of good management because when done well it seems invisible. A manager is the rudder of a ship; hidden at the back but sets the direction of the whole vessel. There is an epidemic of bad management in the world because incompetent managers feel like they need to big note themselves to make it appear like they are doing something to their superiors. So they hold endless meetings and teamwork exercises; all the bs in the world. Don’t feel as though you need to know what they know. You have a different skill set that they are just not going to understand. Who cares. If you don’t know something, ask for clarification. When they say ‘why don’t you know that’ just say ‘I’m not an IT professional’. When they say ‘why are you here then’ you say ‘to manage you’.

"Leading meetings tends to be the bread and butter. You've got to get comfortable with it. I didn't used to like it either but when you fall into a rhythm and have an agenda you just follow it up. -Old action items -New discussion/action items -Questions? Meeting done. Send out the minutes and check in with your members between meetings. If you're getting NO response or answers you escalate to their manager. If THEY don't you escalate to THEIR manager. PMs aren't always loved but we keep people accountable and you're respected more when you do. I was technical earlier on in my career but a lot of the tech has passed me by so while I understand from a high level what SD-WAN does, I don't know the intricacies. I try to have team members explain what i need to functionally operate but really we just come down to planners, schedulers, organizers and mitigators. That's ok. If you don't love this role look for ANOTHER one. The role I've been in for 6 months is actually best ever. I do all the PM stuff and really my technical or Project Leads RUN the meetings themselves.

"When I started as a junior project manager for a software company, I felt the same way—nervous and completely out of my depth. I used to internalize everything until one day I saw the director of the PMO step into a meeting with 15 senior engineers and say, ""Explain this to me like I'm 5 years old."" That moment changed how I viewed my role. The reality is, the reason people sometimes don’t even say hello or answer your questions is that they need you more than they realize. Many software engineers, and I hate to generalize, don’t always know how to facilitate communication or connect with non-technical departments. That’s where your value comes in—connecting teams, facilitating communication, sharing information with other departments, and keeping things organized. I once had a project with one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, and it was totally off the rails simply because they couldn’t communicate. In my first week, I created a Slack chat with all the team members, and suddenly I was praised like I had discovered a new element! All I did was get people talking, but it made a huge impact. You’ve been in your company for two years in a current job environment where layoffs and dismissals happen regularly (IT & SW), which says a lot about the value you bring. Keep learning, keep working on your confidence, and know that you're not alone.

I got all of the funding needed (like $40k) from the four largest segments of the city government, and the mayor approved the projects release.

"Our organization had a similar discussion with risk likelihood and impact. They had a likelihood scale going from 1 (happens more than once a year) to 5 (happens rarely) and an impact going from 1 (takes us out of business) to 5 (no concerning impact). Problem was our biggest risk, “getting hacked” had for 3 years had a 1 and a 1 score. I argued “this risk currently says that we should be going out of business multiple times a year, but in reality it’s two different risks. There’s a low chance we’ll experience a hacker attack that takes us out of business, but there’s a pretty big chance that we will experience attacks that temporarily and locally deny our service.” Now for the analogy. “The risk of snowfall is multiple risks. The first, is the risk of light snowfall. That has a likelihood of 1 (happens often in winter), but an impact of 5 (no major concern, but good to be aware). The risk of heavy snowfall, however, has a major impact (2 or 3) and would close some of our operations temporarily. But the likelihood is very very small, if not nonexistent (5). If you just combine them and consider the worst values (a likelihood of 1 and an impact of 2), we’ll end up spending millions preparing for a non-issue. That’s what we’re currently doing with the hacking issue” My colleagues failed to see the issue and we continued having “getting hacked” as our biggest risk.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-06-08,u/Palludane,https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1danxa3/whats_the_best_analogy_youve_heard_that_tells_the/l7n6nb5/,post: What's the best analogy you've heard that tells the difference between a risk and an issue?

"People forget PMs aren’t supposed to do EVERYTHING on a project. Best to set the tone of accountability from the start. I have noticed over the years, the less accountability given to stakeholders and team members makes more work for myself and more expectations.

"As a PM, you are responsible for communication and the communication plan. A PM should be adding high value communicating between the team and management and other departments/stakeholders. If a meeting between the team and management went slightly of the rails. It would be your issue. My guess is you got feedback on the symptom( you were quiet) not the real issue ( meeting was too high/low level, SMEs went down rabbit holes, topics were not being tabled, meeting went over time, etc..). A PM is expected to facilitate these types of meetings. If the meeting went slightly of track and you were silent, your lack of actively keeping it on track would be a issue. In your shoes, I would get feed back about the quality of the meeting from the stakeholders/managers individually. Knowing your stakeholders and their expectations makes you a better communicater.

"You've already been part of the prep work. Summerize that prep work and who it was with and make acknowledgements/kudos to those team members in front of management. If management questions you, say it is to give them an overview of what you did and with whom and a chance to let employees be recognized in front of management because we all know how important it is. As an added note, throw in some things management did and who it was that made it easier or more consise for the design team. This can be done in a few sentences, the less the better.

"What is your responsibility here? Are you supposed to be driving the meetings? Are you leading, doing intros, taking minutes? It's best to prepare in advance by writing down a list of questions, unknowns, concerns, etc. Bring any open items up at the end. Hammer home the importance of schedules and deliverables. Don't be afraid to be assertive either. Speak out on things that you feel are not aligned. Keep your boss and others around you honest. They'll appreciate you. Keep practicing these habits and you'll find yourself contributing more and more during these meetings.

"In general, I'd say places that make the transition to Agile smoothly are willing to ease in with a more flexible hybrid model.

I find it's usually ""forced"" because the company/department loves ""agile"" as a buzzword for how they're growing/improving for this year.

"Jira is just an app. It's probably the world leader in ""managing work as tickets"", especially for software development. Kanban is a method of managing your work tickets. You have columns for (e.g.) ""to do"" ""in progress"" ""blocked"" ""done"". Work is NOT divided into a cadence, the team just finishes one ticket then starts the next appropriate one. Scrum is a method like kanban, but work IS divided into a time cadence, usually called a sprint. The team makes a commitment to complete X micro-deliverable in the next sprint, work is collected to achieve that, then when a team member is looking for more work they only take on tickets in the current sprint. Agile is the umbrella term that covers methodologies that include kanban and scrum. Agile implies you don't have a fixed requirement-gathering phase before starting delivery work, the two are blended together; it also includes an iterative delivery process where you don't wait until the whole product is done to ship completed components. Honestly there's a lot of nuance to these and related methodologies. It is worth researching in more detail. I should also point out that I've never worked at a company that's followed any particular methodology religiously.

"My team uses kanban boards on Jira (which is a type of project management software) to track out various assignments/projects. We’re able to seed each one with the information it needs, assign a priority for each item, and then send it out to one of several boards we have. We assign different team members to different boards based on their area of specialty; some have work on multiple boards. From there, our team members can select which item they’ll take on next based on priority and what they’re most familiar with, and track it from draft through completion, and parts that need to be reintegrated get reintegrated toward the end of the process. Each item has links to relevant files and unique identifiers that help us track them efficiently. It’s basically just a way to track assignments and self-assign work that needs doing.

"The Kanban is a stage gates project methodology similar to a todo list. You start off with small tasks essentially written on sticky notes. You start with a back log of all your tasks and you move them trhough stages like to do, doing, done. Other people might have other stages, but that’s the basics. There are tools, like Jira that do this for you electronically. Scrum is an Agile method of software development. You again create small tasks as weight them with a common measurement, sometimes people call it points, others call it tshirt sizes, it’s a bit irrelevant. Tasks are again put in a backlog and various roles build a series of development cycles called sprints. sprints are usually short, two or three week bursts of development where these features are built. The team does testing and then when ready they release an initial minimum viable product, or MVP. Additional releases are made after additional backlog grooming and sprint planning. Jira is a tool made by Atlassian that is used as a project management tool. It can be used in various flavors of software development such as Scrum and Kanban. Agile is a mindset designed to create software through an entirely different thought process. It’s not a methodology and there are references like the manifesto that guide you through their thought process. There are two schools of thought. Some think it’s the greatest thing in the world, others think it’s an endless cycle of development that costs way too much.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-06-02,u/pmpdaddyio,https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1d6qihe/can_someone_please_explain_kanban_scrum_jira_and/l6u6b86/,"post: Can someone please explain Kanban, Scrum, Jira and Agile in simple terms? or anything else that I need to know of to know them better."

"I've always been a planner, and that played a part in transitioning to PM. However, some of what I've dealt with as a PM has influenced how I plan in my personal life. * More flexible on decisions that have no dependencies/low-impact * I'm now likely to direct the conversation rather than allow it to slide to last minute decision making * I have a better gauge for what is important and requires more rigorous planning vs what can be more relaxed/spontaneous * Tendency to offer options rather than ask open-endedly for someone's opinion * My plans now have contingencies built-in and I'm less likely to over-plan Holidays with my family are a great example. Typically, I'd ask several weeks in advance what I could do to help. I'd be assured that it's all handled and nothing is required of me. Then the day before, there'd be utter chaos - multiple desserts and no 'real' food, last-minute preparation, too few serving utensils, no counter space/extra space set up, three people would make mac and cheese, last-minute requests for me to pick up things even though I'm traveling several hours just to get there, no one knows what time they should arrive, etc. I'm not even kidding - one year we had 12 people and 8 different dessert dishes. Another year, there were multiple starches and no veggies. This year, I just asked if they would like to do a potluck (it's always been a potluck), then signed myself up for a few things. Within an hour, we had a full menu, better distribution (in terms of work and the actual meal), set time for lunch, and activities for the kids. We avoided some of the last-minute scramble, and we're now aware of what others are doing. I know it's likely that my mom will bring a random extra dessert, and my sister might still make mac and cheese, but the bases are covered. The caveat: I feel like I'm one step away from walking around with a clipboard and checklist at all times lol",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-11-18,u/oystercrackerinsoup,https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1gu7a53/how_has_being_a_pm_affected_your_nonprofessional/lxsfh6w/,post: How has being a PM affected your non-professional life
"When we undertake projects at our house, I (the PM) meet with every contractor to explain I’m a professional PM, communication and coordination are key. If, during the initial scoping phase of the project, they don’t communicate, don’t deliver proposals on time, don’t show up for meetings on time or are late etc, they won’t get the work. I once had a landscaper try to bill me for “extra work” he supposedly did 8 months earlier. The bill was like $1,000. There was no communication about it, no bill, until 8 months later. He couldn’t produce any evidence of the extra work, I had evidence of closing out scope with him, that everything was satisfactory. I paid for the services the day it was complete. It was all in writing. I never paid for “the extra work”. He couldn’t even provide an invoice. I thought he was scamming me. He sent a demand letter through his lawyer and provided some false invoice with dates that didn’t even match our project. I provided all facts to my lawyer who responded to the demand letter.

"I'm in my first role as a PM, but far from my first role as an engineer. I legitimately don't understand this issue , and to me, it suggests you are either not setting the boundary between work and actual life, or you're not enforcing the boundary between the two. Nobody calls me of a weekend or an evening, and to do so means the project had better on fire, or you're going to catch the temper. If it's you bringing work into your personal life, then you need to work on enforcing your own boundaries. If your workload is too great for you to cope with your contracted hours, then your employer needs to render support to you. If they won't, don't empower them. Move on, there's plenty more roles out there. Edit: the actual answer, nope, can plan a project, but as soon as 4 pm comes, everything is back to winging it.

Set your vision for the project, then get the team to define the project charter which sets out the teams rules and expected behaviors and hold them to them. Then, for each role on the project, write a very clear set of roles, accountabilities, responsibilities, and authorities and get each one to agree to them. When one of them deviates from these, you can call them out and hold them to account. The above may get them in line or you may end up just battling with them every single day to simply do their job.

"I've been in a similar position twice and that too early in my career. In one case I was lucky to have a mentor. For that one I was new to the team and even the junior devs had more knowledge of the domain than I did. Based on my mentor's advice I set forth to win their respect. CI-CD was in its infancy then and our CEO wanted to get it implemented across all the projects that we ran. I took the lead, learned about it from various sources, and implemented it for our project as a pilot. While I was not a dev this required only basic scripting that I was able to learn. When I demonstrated this to the team they were able to appreciate that I am keen to learn and that my work contributes positively to the team. This made me earn their respect and get them to cooperate on the mechanisms that I set up for the project. For the other case, it was a startup and everybody did their own thing. I tried a lot to get the team to structure their work for planning and updates but they believed it was a waste of time. Though we had Jira I had to chase people to get updates manually and was rarely successful in that as most of them would only give vague answers that they will get the work done (no information shared on ETA, dependencies, risks, tasks, nothing!) The CTO was the site lead and he didn't care about goals or a unifying plan. I ended up leaving the company owing to lack of vision. The lesson that I learned from my experiences is the importance of strong leadership who sets common goals and vision. Others have shared the same learning and I thought to explain it further using my own experiences of a win and a failure.

"Make no mistake, project management is hard work. I often tell my team of PMs that if delivery was easy, you wouldn't need project managers. I think lots of organisations do not appreciate the value project management adds, or don't have the structure to support effective project delivery which leads to a lot of people feeling disillusioned with their project management career. I work in an organisation which is very project orientated. So I feel pretty valued and I get the support of stakeholders when building project teams and they give it the focus the project needs. While that makes things easier on some levels, it is still very challenging to get things delivered for other reasons and every employer will have their own unique set of constraints and issues. For me, I take satisfaction from solving problems, making end user lives better and taking a fresh project demand and making it real. Another source of satisfaction for me is developing people.

"This doesn't fit with my experience of PM at all. Especially the part about doing the work. In my experience, if the PM needs to get their hands dirty, it's always as a last resort not as an ideal. Aside from that, I think it depends heavily on what method you're using. For example, Scrum is the very opposite of what you're describing. The way I see it, in most cases, whatever tools and processes a company is using are there for a reason, even if that reason no longer exists. It's fine to want to eliminate as much waste as possible (a Lean approach to PM itself), but you'll never get rid of all of it, especially the data gathering and reporting. Projects exist within a context and communicating your status and details out to that larger context will *always* be part of the job. That comes with admin tasks. I will say, though, that you're mostly right about orgs thinking that a new tool or platform will solve whatever institutional problem they're facing.

You also have to document both of those things. Tools are meant to help and facilitate with both of those processes. Maybe you are using the wrong tools? I have this issue with a lot of new projects managers. Project management isn't just forwarding emails or sending followups. You need to plan, direct, manage, track and report on the activities.

"the challenge is to meet cost and quality , these are the most controversial issues for PM, as contractors shall and will cut corners (or unnecessary changeovers/substitutions) to increase their profits, which increases the overall cost by rework of substandard work and the time impact on delivering the project.

"I have no idea why some folks are so touchy here even if someone mentions even the slightest drawbacks of the PM role. You are right and wrong. The PM's job is not just following up but that would be around 40% of the job in most cases. Basically a project manager is there to ensure engineers are able to work in the given deadline, any risks should be communicated with stakeholders, any resourcing, budget risk should be handled. A PM should ideally have a very clear understanding of the requirements of the project. Follow-ups are just one part of the job and not the whole job. If you think you have to do too many follow ups, find a way to delegate and automate it. Set reminders, call out the folks who do not adhere and set some processes in place to minimize your repeated manual effort",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-11-08,u/wanderer_314,https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1gm6mcc/isnt_pm_just_following_up_after_all/lw0qp1r/,post: Isn’t PM just following up after all?

"Time to change. Three things stand out here: **Boundaries** - Sounds like you are trying to please everyone by working too hard; when at the end of the day you are paying the price with your health, both physically and mentally. Set expectations and stick to them. Escalate everything that is majorly out of whack with the project. The odd early start and late finish is not the issue - the repeated daily habit this is becoming is not sustainable. **Long Term Planning** - At its core organising people and projects is a valuable skill. Sounds like something you enjoy and want to do in the future. Transfering those skills to another role or industry is easily done with some research and looking around what is in the market. Take time to look around, even at industries you wouldn't consider. **Short Term Planning** - Take a step back and prioritise the huge list of stuff that needs doing.

"I do appreciate the position you're in and dealing with heavy expectation in the role that you're in. Burn out is derived from being overwhelmed and high levels of workload. The reality is you will end up burning out repeatedly and will take its' toll on you professionally and personally if you remain in the path that you're on. From personal experience and seeing several common denominator with other PM's in the past, it comes down to a several causes. Firstly, difficulty in controlling your triple constraints of Time, Cost and Scope and managing up when tolerances will or are going to breach the agreed KPI levels. Manage upwards and be more definitive. The second major observation is understanding roles and responsibilities with strong delegation authority. You have outlined engineering not finishing drawings as an example. Push back as you have paid for a service or hold payment until it's done and or escalate internally as an example. You're not the subject matter expert, it's your Engineers responsibility to delivery. I have learnt some very hard lessons in the past by taking on responsibility that wasn't mine. Thirdly, assess how you are communicating i.e. project plan, status reports etc. This will ensure that you're setting the expectations that you either need or want. Lastly, you need to learn to switch off after work, ensure that you're looking after yourself mentally and physically or you will end up with burn out a lot quicker. Ensure you can distract yourself through hobbies, things that interest you. As an example for me I took up landscape photography, it makes me stay in the moment (I'm not thinking about work) and as I can't get the sun to rise or set any quicker when after a particular shot, it teaches me patience, plus I'm out doors. As you become more seasoned as a PM these things will become easier, after 22 years I'm still learning. Just an armchair observation.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-09-25,u/More_Law6245,https://reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1fota5p/realizing_i_dont_want_to_pm_anymore/lota4pu/,post: Realizing I Dont Want to PM Anymore

"Maybe a shift out of construction might be worth looking at, or perhaps to operations or performance excellence. Burnout is linked to feeling unhappy about the work you're doing, not necessarily how intense it is. I'm going through a similar thing at the moment and can definitely relate. Some steps to consider: 1 - Step back. Realise that how you do things isn't how the organisation is positioned at the moment. Is the stress there because things aren't being done how you would expect them or is it because of feedback saying things aren't going well. For me, I thought things weren't going well because they could have been much smoother but project stakeholders thought things were going well. I was creating stress by not adapting to the situation and letting go of how things ""should be"". 2 - Establish a baseline aligned to what key stakeholders want. It might be different to your standards but learn to tailor and influence via small steps. 3 - Focus on the elements that you do like, or can derive some personal value from. Developing others as you navigate this situation could prove to be rewarding. 4 - Give yourself a break. You're doing what you can and it's not easy. If you genuinely feel it's not for you, take steps to pivot to another job or another industry or role. It sounds like operations management might really suit you as it's hands on and is outcome based.

"Ask for help internally and redefine the job roles associated with the project. Also, you need to have a clear understanding of what is important (critical path) vs what is not. Never over promise on any work streams associated with the project internally or externally. If your answers are not a ""confident yes"" then don't ever say yes. Every team member internally and externally has their own agenda, and it's up to you to prioritise as per the project. Get an ai note taker for all of your online calls to help with meeting minutes. Use chat gpt to help with comms and documentation. Also I find getting up early and just going for a walk and then setting a to do for the day is really helpful for me. Hope this helps.

"In construction if I did everything I needed to do I’d be sending out resumes because if it’s that slow I’ll soon be let go. Nobody is ever caught up. You have 8 hours. If the assigned work exceeds it, go home. It will be there tomorrow. I can do anything a junior/support person can do. I can do it faster with fewer mistakes. But while I do that, my other tasks don’t get done. And yes training takes time away eventually you are taking on more. Second I keep a literal white board with a task list or schedule on it. When the boss wants to add something you refer to the white board and ask where to add it, and maybe the low priority stuff should be simplified or removed. You can only write so much so it physically makes it a forced choice. And they can see those other tasks not getting done. And anything past item 8-10 never gets done. Others should go through the same thing. If what they’re asking can’t be done over the phone or email, schedule the work. “This is going to take some time. I’m already booked up today and tomorrow. How does X sound? Well if you need to make it a priority I’ll have to bump something else. Let me contact my boss. I can’t just change the schedule.” Then contact your boss about what task to cut to accommodate the GC. After a couple times both will be trained. Or if one if your assistants is that useless assign them to the GC tasks, and slow roll everything, GCs are used to pushing around their subs. They see the whole world as nails and use a hammer every time as a universal solution. Don’t tolerate that. When they work with you then work with them. I can be surprisingly accommodating when you don’t try to push me around. And sorry but construction is mass chaos. Contractors are territorial and never think past tomorrow or about other jobs going on. If you don’t manage them work flow is destroyed and everything becomes a serial task.

"I do a lot of consultancy work for central government as a technical advisor. The project was to finish a half-built school after the previous contractor went out of business. The new contractor was very switched on and refused to take the risk on ground contamination (and hadn't done their own ground investigation). My client asked for my recommendation and risk analysis for them to hold this risk. I reviewed the GI done during the early feasibly stage of the project, and the previous contractor's GI, and found no evidence of any ground contamination, so I advised that it is unlikely for ground contamination to exist on the site, and the risk is low, but then added the caveat, unless the previous contractor themselves contaminated the ground after completing their GI. The client was satisfied to proceed into contract on this basis. It turns out that this is precisely what the previous contractor did. They used the demolition arisings from the existing building onsite as fill material, which contained old plasterboard waste. When ground or rain water got in it would activate a sulphate reaction against the non-sulphate-resistant concrete foundations they had put in.

"So I’ve been in this spot a few times, and finally had an epiphany: Effort != Value See, you probably thought that you had to go against the grain, and force people to make changes in order to deliver value. But in so thinking, you likely defined what “value”meant to YOU, and thought that your job was to align other people to this. It wasn’t. If it’s a feature factory, you’ve essentially got two options: the company is making money, or it isn’t. If the company is making money, helping people to be more “right” by aligning them to your definition of value is not necessarily helpful, and may actually be destructive. If the company isn’t making money, then it’s likely to be very difficult to get any changes to occur, and the level of effort for you is not aligned with the potential reward, unless you are a founder. So how can you add the most value? By helping the company do what it already wants to do, but faster and with less effort. Which is likely much easier to do, will take much less time or effort, and won’t make you many enemies. Will you be making the company the best that it is possible for the company to be? Probably not. But are you delivering the most value possible for your role and influence? Probably. If I walk out in my yard, and try to knock my walnut tree over by pushing against it, it could take a ton of effort, without actually providing any value whatsoever. If the tree needs to come down, a chainsaw will do the trick handily, and I wouldn’t be a hero for trying to push a tree over for a year that I could have cut down in 15 minutes.

At a past company i once got bumped from manager back to analyst. They didn't replace me just tried eliminating a dept. But still asked me to do basically most of the same things. I started doing way less and even spent a couple weeks polishing my resume during work. After a month or so they pulled me in and gave me a raise saying i was doing much better work than before. Which is absolutely not true but i was able to spend more time doing fewer things. I don't even think it was more impact but their expectations were substantially less. From the product world I've recently been slowed down with the work for similar reasons although there's still a bunch to do. I genuinely don't understand why people will populate a company of roles without really understanding what everyone is doing and why.

"Lots of positive responses already. Maybe you will answer some of these critiques. There is a great deal of senior level strategy here that clearly differentiates you from others who might attempt this and it has give me some things to think about for my own roles, so thanks for that. It does feel like you completely under delivered on the actual prompt though. Their goal was to 8.5x in 4 years. If the tech segment in the US is less than 10M roles in 2024, even rolling in other applicable segments would require an unrealistic expectation for market share to move the needle and it still falls woefully short. So a strong international distribution model is the only option. I would expect to see more on direct integrations, partnerships, team structure and approach to international penetration in general. Listing SEO as the only meaningful acquisition channel is just incomplete. The Roadmap and the OKR's are a start in the right direction but are not sufficient to meet the 50-100% growth they would need in year 1 to stay on track. Recommending cleaning up the core experience and 'researching to find underserved needs' reflected in the Big Bets and Initiatives is microscopic compared to the challenges of building distribution, the elephant in the room.

"A lot of what you say we need to be is what the product management function was full of. If there is an identity crisis it’s due to the last tech growth period that made the job sexy. It’s never been that, and it’s always been a grind that you either love or hate. Unfortunately, people are coming into it due to the money and what they view as prestige. Product has always been about the driving of a defined business value through the lens of a product or service. That value used to clearly be measured in revenue, but as the function became more metric-oriented (often self-defined metrics), we saw an evolution of new Product roles focused on smaller areas of a whole. They one lead who owned the end-to-end has become fuzzy. That’s ok, as the complexity of companies and products demand that. Unfortunately, it means a lot of PMs don’t have a full grasp on their impact (chasing a single metric), which makes it difficult to explain your role at times. Companies of a particular size still need people who can be accountable to driving product development against a business goal. That can be done by others in an org (Eng, design, marketing), but each of them typically are burdened by their own org needs to properly drive to the biz need. That’s not a criticism, just a function of their role, their time, and their incentives. And then if you add in the personality of the company or founder, you’ll likely see some in those roles take outsized responsibilities that may traditionally go to Product, further making it confusing as to what product is. So if you’ve made it this far, ignore all the gurus out there who try to cookie cutter the role. Focus on doing what’s fact-based and right for the customer as it relates to the needs of the business and fight like hell to get it out the door. It’s just that simple.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-10-28,u/KosstAmojen,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1ge4d0t/after_13_or_so_years_im_out_of_product_management/lu73z28/,"post: After 13 or so years, I'm out of Product Management - this is my farewell to the field"
"The identity challenge in Product Management (in my humble opinion) is about creep. Whatever the organization is not good at becomes the problem of the products team. And once you fix one problem, the company realizes there are other weaknesses. This is why PMs burn out or shift to executive functions.

"i think we are wired differently. im happy for you that you put in the time and got the t-shirt, noped out and are ready for your next challenge product management doesnt have an identity crisis, *product managers* do. especially new ones, and especially ones in tech. product management is, and always has been, about looking to the market, finding an unmet need or under served group, making something to address it, maketing it, and capitalizing on it technology is, and always has been, a means to an end. “oh, i need to buy a widget? here’s a website for you” to hell with that, i can drive to the store. tech makes things more *accessible*. its an efficiency play for something else that can be done in another way. this is about unlocking value. and too many PM’s dont know what it is, how to define it, or if it was right in front of their face. with so much money flying around, founders needed people to execute their bullshit and since it was software, and the code was the only tangible asset (in addition to the customer list) it became “product”. tech did it to itself.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-10-28,u/Bob-Dolemite,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1ge4d0t/after_13_or_so_years_im_out_of_product_management/lu7z78b/,"post: After 13 or so years, I'm out of Product Management - this is my farewell to the field"

"Really appreciate both posts, as a PM for the last 8 years I really agree with practically everything you’ve said. Product Management is going to look very different over the coming years. A lot of the problems you mention really are coming to a head, kind of “the situation has to get bad enough until real change happens”. I can see the pendulum starting to swing. There will be a huge consolidation of roles on the standard tech team - anyone’s guess on exactly what that looks like though. However, if there are 3 broad “buckets” of things a PM does… (1) generate insight, (2) strategy/direction, and (3) get things done, then you can kind of see where it’s all likely headed. Design function will take more of the generate insight piece, engineering leads will take more of the get things done piece. That only leaves the strategy/direction piece left… and there’s no real reason there needs to be one of those on every tech team. Product is either going to be even more senior skewed, or it’s going to have its identity crisis come to its logical conclusion of being a strategy manager or whatever title you want to insert. Who knows how this plays out though, but change is really happening and it’s being felt. I’m also on my way out of Product, into a more technical / hard skills field, so really relate to the idea of leaving.

"To be the (lone?) optimist… I agree that the role has been cheapened by a lot of these forces ([Marty's post on ""Product Management Theater"" lays out well](https://www.svpg.com/product-management-theater/)), and maybe this has even become the majority norm, but if you’re in a decent company culture, a lot of the concerns around being too output oriented (confusion with project management), or being an easy target are alleviated. Strong “product led” companies do exist. If you’re genuinely centralizing a thoughtful strategy, for real problems people have, and inspiring people to help solve it, PM us a real thing that is not crisis.

If you're looking to stay remote, there are still plenty of companies that prioritise flexibility, especially in the tech space. It might come down to specific company culture and leadership preferences, so keeping an eye on which companies are being firm on RTO mandates could help guide your decision. Not being ready to move from a MCOL city is totally understandable, and there are still a lot of opportunities with companies that value remote work ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-09-16,u/squadai,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1fif9tf/amazon_rto_5_days_a_week/lngxuu6/,post: Amazon RTO 5 days a week

"I think the 3 day RTO places will now move to 5 day. TikTok, Amazon, etc. started it and Google, MS, etc. will follow. The places that went full remote will use it as an advantage to hire top talent at lower rates. Or hire flexible hub office locations (SF, SEA, NY) where you RTO to a hub.

"I don't know about trends but I think most who push for strict RTO are trying to drive organic attrition. If the goal really was the culture then the policies would be more flexible to allow teams to connect in ways that work for them and their schedules. I think remote is here to stay, I think it will always be a ""perk"" now like tuition reimbursement or good insurance. Not all companies will have it but those who do will attract good talent. You can still attract the TOP talent by just throwing money at them and expecting them to come to office too so it's not true that you're losing all your good talent by not going remote. For a lot of people a fat paycheck can justify a move and for most companies giving a few people fat paychecks is better than giving everyone remote.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-09-17,u/burrito_napkin,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1fif9tf/amazon_rto_5_days_a_week/lnk8rxw/,post: Amazon RTO 5 days a week

">I know what a product manager does. Every word you spend describing the duties of your role is wasted. This makes sense in theory, but... 1. Recruiters often don't work that way. They are typically the first line of human review for applicants and will screen out resumes that don't explicitly mention the specific responsibilities they're looking for. I've received feedback on this practice even for basic skills like ""working cross-functionally with designers, engineers, marketers, etc."" 2. ATS will screen out your resume unless you have reflected the stated experience/responsibilities from the job posting. While I applaud you for looking at every resume, many companies rely heavily on ATS to screen out applicants. So, your resume needs to cater to ATS first and foremost, which means ensuring that the duties from the job posting are reflected in your resume in some form.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-10-10,u/infolink324,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1g0gck7/some_tips_from_a_hiring_manager_apm_to_spm/lr9gb4e/,post: Some tips from a hiring manager (APM to SPM)

I haven’t been able to land a job although have been close but a lot of what you pointed out about the resume I am guilty of so this was a great help for me to see inside the mind of a hiring manager. Needless to say I will rework my resume to fit your suggestions. One question I have though is that you mention not describe what you did as a PM because you know what a PM does but a lot of companies out there are using ATS systems to filter out resumes that don’t have the key words they are looking for so we as job seekers are trained to include all of that info so we can get past the filter, so how do you recommend to accomplish this with your approach?

"This is such a great list, but unfortunately I fear only works when the team, or hiring manager is reviewing the resumes. When recruiters, internal or external, are doing the initial intake, those basic skills and run of the mill descriptions are critical. Our internal HR team had approximately zero understanding of software product, and had a check list they went by. Results wouldn’t mean anything to them because they wouldn’t know what it meant. Not to mention the automation tools that are looking for keywords. That said, this has made me feel like it would be good for me to have two versions, in case I’m applying for the job that has an actual, qualified person reviewing applications.

"I saw a lot of comments question the data, but I would say as a PM Leader with salary authorization in companies perennially at or near the “top pay by PM level” list: levels.fyi reported pay packages for top BigTech / hot startups is very accurate. Typically if we make an offer lower than those ranges, we end up seeing ourselves in a competitive “which offer to take” poll post on Blind and not surprisingly usually lose out. Great PMs are very expensive (and well worth the price). However, I am very surprised by the analysis about top PMs pay superior to SWEs. As at two different companies I’ve been at over the last 10 years the rule of thumb is PM level band is SWE band -1. ie, L6 equivalent PMs are roughly comparable band to L5 equivalent SWEs. I am also surprised at median TC for Senior and PM Leadership being where it’s at. It feels low, which is a sign maybe I’ve been spoiled too much by BigTech / hot startups.

A lot of legacy non-tech companies see PMs as doers, and only trust business teams to plan the roadmaps. This will never change unless there is an upheaval in leadership.

"If someone came to me and told me they did a ""Five Forces"" analysis and came up with a new roadmap for my product, I'd (a) laugh them out of the room and (b) tell their manager to find them some real work. Nobody cares about your MBA buzzword frameworks. If you have a product team that is absolutely drowning, they might appreciate help - *but you should ask them what help they need.* When colleagues approach me with an interest in PM work, I'm able to select projects for them with appropriate scope, where I have adequate familiarity to provide feedback and course-correct if they've gone in entirely the wrong direction. I pick projects that are high priority without being critical path, and am generally able to manage the risk of a major screwup. But jumping straight into a large ""strategic"" scope is a waste of time and unlikely to be appreciated. Most PMs already have enough cooks in the kitchen with their managers and stakeholders - having the people who are supposed to be executing adding to the pile is a nightmare. I have given projects to people interested in PM and had them come back to me within a week and say that after digging into things with users, there seems to be decent-enough workarounds, and they don't think it's worth solving this problem. *That's great.* Then they get bigger scopes, more ambiguity, and more responsibility.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-09-27,u/contralle,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1fqw4f6/dont_ask_for_permission_or_wait_to_be_invited/lp9b7qt/,post: Don't ask for permission or wait to be invited

If you are a good PM I think you can be good at most things. Being good at understanding what the customer needs and synthesizing across groups is a fundamental building block of higher level roles. I pivoted from a product management IC directly into a senior leadership role at a $10+ billion company in an area that was similar to that of the products I was experienced in. From there I moved into a C-suite role at a smaller company making triple what I did in product. Most recently left that role to start a company with a very talented dev I used to work with. I think a lot of people get caught up on the experience they have with specific skills, but it's more important to focus on what the competencies are that enabled that experience and then figure out what other jobs they will perform well in.

"I hit rock bottom myself this past spring (after 20 years in product) -- final straw was management who kept things in their heads about what they thought the org needed and then expected me to magically read their minds? Insert head banging here. So I did a few things: 1. Got my body right, set boundaries I doubled down on some things that really mattered to me, namely lifting weights and running. This meant I couldn't work late and sometimes I had to run midday (I work remotely). I started work later (9/9:30 AM) and left work earlier (5 PM on the dot) to accommodate my workout schedule. 2. Got my head right, dropped the fear I said to myself -- I am working hard during those work hours and the worst thing that can happen is they let me go. (They would never fire me because lawsuits and all that stuff.) If they let me go I will have severance and then unemployment -- for awhile. And that will give me space to figure out a next step. And voila -- guess what happened. I had the best six months I have ever had at work -- EVER. I got accolades from other divisions for my work and even got a merit raise. OMG Why hadn't I been doing this for the previous 20 years? Anyway -- lesson is -- set boundaries, set your mind right, run the experiment, see if that changes your work circumstances.

"I personally thinks it’s a reaction to a market where very few new products are being launched. That drives a reduction in overall headcount, and especially PM headcount. If you don’t need X full time PMs, maybe you can get X employees who are actively doing design or coding in addition to PM duties. I think it’s reasonable to some degree, but to only hire PMs who can code is silly, like only hiring PMs with a consulting or banking background, or only PMs who can make graphic designs.

"Regardless of how we feel within the PM world, this is part of the external industry-level conversation across the majority of socials. I think this is a response to a tightening market, with companies and startups particularly still seeing the value of PMs, but knowing that fundamentally budgets have constraints. If they didn't feel this way they'd...just hire an engineer lol I also have started to feel that a new baseline for PMs at companies building tech products is having some sort of technical knowledge or ability (inc self taught stuff). Imagine working at a bread factory and wanting to improve the recipe for customers but not knowing anything about baking. Knowing how to code isn't the same as coding. There isn't the same time and luxury to let others deal with the gritty detail. A senior engineer can't spend a few hours a week explaining architecture to a PM anymore, a PM needs to be able to be able to pick it up themselves and ask the right questions. We've lost the luxury of time over the last 2 years. I say this as an ex engineer turned PM. I've watched peers from non technical backgrounds struggle with this new reality in a way I have not felt.

"Hi all, I wanted to create a small conceptual framework that’s kind of “object orientated” (or at least has some of the principles) - i.e. the steps are self contained, but build on top of each other. Something visual so it’s clear how each part plays a role. That allows a bet to be developed. So the addition of new data (that perhaps wasn’t considered before) can be seen to change an insight / bet. I could see this being a Miro template (to help develop bets with Design, Research, Eng) or to present the information to stakeholders. Perhaps as a set of Google Slides too. It being somewhat modular would mean an Insight (and it’s supporting data) could still be relevant to another project - and therefore reusable. Bets could even become insights if (after released) they are ‘validated’, that would in turn contribute to future Bets. The benefit being - you can play around with the data / insights / bets a bit more visually - and (if your job is anything like mine) could reduce time spent writing out docs / presentation slides, etc. Help get the team / stakeholders more involved / aligned. Perhaps surface assumptions / logical errors. Curious to hear what this community thinks? I’ve created an image with a dummy example to explain the idea. Have you used something like this before? Do you think it would be beneficial for your team? This is I suppose how I've thought about developing bets - but visualised a bit more.

"Firstly, welcome to product management! Not sure where you got the idea that being a product manager would be easy - the conversation is normally the opposite 😁 As for the politics, well... that's the REAL job of a PM. It doesn't matter how great your vision or roadmap is. Your job is to sell it to the organisation so that it can be executed. If you can't do that, then nothing happens.

"lol, these are indeed questions a new PM will have. You should check back to this post 3-4 years from now and take stock how much you would have grown. Here are some tips: 1. Find a good PM mentor who can help you navigate these questions 2. Adopt a growth mindset—who you are today will not be the same a year from now 3. Learn to say palatable ‘no’s to meetings, scope and commitments so that you have the bandwidth to say ‘yes’ to the the things that generate impact 4. 20% of your effort will generate 80% of your impact. try to figure out what those are for your scope, speak to your mentor/manager about this 5. Deep read books / selective chapters in books but don’t take it as gospel truth. find what works for you and your context (also avoid schooling people with what you read unless it’s tried and tested by you, it’ll only reveal your experience) 6. Learn to build trust & relationships with people you agree disagree with. Also understand what matters to them and see how everyone can act as a team to deliver impact 7. Have 1 on 1s with people you work closely with to build relationship and alignment the list goes on but i guess these will form part of the impactful 20% that will help you.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-11-28,u/Teruwa,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1h1kr0o/contrary_to_popular_belief_this_is_not_an_easy_job/lzcc5jk/,"post: Contrary to popular belief, this is not an easy job"

Also, just because someone accepted the first offer they got (would probably be crazy not to in this climate) doesn't mean it was a ton of money.

Silicon valley being the epicenter. The technology and application stack (not just eng, design, prod, and large areas of dev) haven't been advancing at the rate it use to. It's just been optimizing and it's easier and more cost effective to optimize abroad. Especially for companies that have been previously acquired and aren't worried about the innovation race.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-07-23,u/purepeep,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1ea1q1k/pm_with_4_ye_job_search/lej02hl/,post: PM with 4 y/e job search

"Here’s what I dont like about the other director, who’s on a different team and a different product not related to mine: 1. They get involved in a bad way in our group’s practices. I focus heavily on user problems and we have our way of working. He constantly tries to force his way on us, including how to track data, making up a meeting to “present adoption metrics” just for the sale of it. (No he doesn’t manage us in no way. We report to the same person). 2. He ships products for the sake of it without research. Ironically he gets no adoption for his products and features. 3. We both share roadmap sessions with clients meaning sometimes I will take it and other times he will. While I am able to present his stuff he constantly needs “reminders “ on our area, 20 min before his meeting. He is always unprepared. 4. We have a product management meeting every 2 weeks for all of us, both groups. He always wants to cancel and shows bad leadership in my eyes. 5. He talks to my dev team leads directly and asks them to build stuff for him, not going through the relevant PM as expected even though I asked him several times. I never needed help from his teams.

"This is great. Customer interviews are the best source of information, imo. Really great if you can be onsite, I can’t tell you the times that I have seen sticky notes with steps or the craziest workarounds that have been accepted so they never mentioned them on the call. These unarticulated needs are key. One note for the product manager that really knows the product, if a customer during an interview asks you how to do something with your product, DO NOT answer them. I made this mistake during my first customer interview and ruined the whole thing, they shutdown as they deemed I knew more than them. What I learned from that mistake, ask “how would you like to see it done” and then I made a note, if I knew the answer I would only tell them at the end when I was leaving (or in an email later) if I didn’t know I would just tell them I will have someone get back to them.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-12-11,u/washdoubt,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1hc1p75/how_i_run_customer_interviews_and_why_theyre/m1kutu7/,post: How I run customer interviews (and why they're better than analytics for 0-1)

Don’t be afraid to include a “Hail Mary,” a big idea that might be unrealistically ambitious- but if you do make sure you present this with appropriate caveats and within any predestined constraints.

"He did a good job building a community and sharing his thoughts in the early days.

I’d still recommend listening and absorbing, but broadening your perspective more, test what you learn, and adapt what you can to your own context.

"Thought Leadership, with extremely great skills in English Grammar Shreyas mostly uses a very good use of Vocab and make simple things look complex. (so people who don't know PM will consider him a great PM). Also most of his inputs come from reading books written by techies who were Old Money PM (read, PMs from 85s-20s). Personally, I find him or his inputs to be very bookish and not practical. (may be the 20% could be). Most of the folks following him are Associates or Aspiring PMs + Mid-Career PMs. Tell them about Roadmap and they will orgasm. But running a Product org is beyong writing fancy tweets and thought leadership. Real PMs, VPs and CPOs are busy building Products and Projects. Ask Shreyas if he can turn a negative project or product into profit making, he might just talk about strategies, but when it comes to execution and actually delivering dollar $$$ to IRS he would not be able to do so. Sure, He has pedigree? Well, if you are rightly placed in SF, you could be at at Top 10% company and call as ""PM @ Fortune 100 Co, Previously at Fortune 500"". Again, not concluding him as fake, he surely has identified a great gap and good audience (target) and he is making money with his writing skills, so criticism is easy but if you already at a 15+ yrs of experience and if you are NOT an ass, you probablly know more than him or equal to him, it may be that you aren't penning it down, coz you are busy executing.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-08-19,u/neeldomx,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1eusm3l/please_explain_the_hype_behind_shreyas_doshi/liuvqdb/,post: Please explain the hype behind Shreyas Doshi

"I followed his posts and I still do. I also attended one of his workshop. I think his posts are well summarized for early in career professional and could be useful to some extent. However over time I have realized 1. Most of his frameworks and points are taken from other books - for example LNO framework (a derivative of eisenhower matrix) and many other frameworks are taken from other books. Most irritating part is that he never gives credit to original author and book but will ask people to give credit to him for posting the framework. He once posted list of books on Twitter (long time ago) check those books out and you will see what I’m saying. I have had so many instances of seeing his framework, which reminded me of original book/author, and then wondering why is he not mentioning the source material and actual author from where this is adopted and inspired. 2. After attending the workshop I started getting emails that if I posted good thing about workshop I will get free membership to product this and workshop that. I didn’t bite but I won’t be surprised a lot of people will bite and post good things about workshop to get free goodie’s. 3. My biggest concern with these framework gurus is that they ruin the industry where people with real industry experience are expected to vomit these frameworks in interviews to get job offers. Like circles framework is great starting point but it’s not how real life works, real life is not that simple, and then interviewers will expect interviewees to answer in frameworks even when the real life answer will be a bit different.

"Awesome post! I wanted to share some market trends I’ve noticed, based on my experience as a PM and conversations with engineers and other PMs. There’s a noticeable shift away from microservices lately. Over the past decade, companies have realised that managing microservices can be overly complex, costly, and inefficient. Here are a few things I’ve noticed / read: - Shopify talks a lot about a “federated monolith, which combines the simplicity of monoliths with the flexibility of modules. This approach was highlighted at the most recent Rust conference. - Monoliths are making a comeback, especially in Europe. While interviewing for new roles, I saw this trend firsthand. One prime example (pun intended) is Amazon Prime Video, which switched to a monolith and cut costs by something like 90% That said, microservices still work well for large, complex systems, but they aren’t a fit for everyone. I’ve seen legacy companies, especially in banking, adopt microservices recently.

Nitpicking or what if scenarios, to me, means they really are thinking and wanting to make things better. “Looks great” means they didn’t really look at it. But the nitpickers aren’t really filtering their feedback. Only a small percentage of their feedback falls into the “needs action” bucket and some into the “needs more research”.

"Good approach. I think realizing this is one critical learning point every PM has to go through. You're very engaged with your product, want to do great and be engaging with the feedback of others ... until you realize: they're not ""providing feedback"", they're just inventing unreasonable scenarios out of thin air and call this feedback. Or critique a wireframe or design based on ""how nice it looks"" and then you get visual feedback (""I would have moved the button to the top-right""). One must learn to filter the actual propable scenarios and work on those, thank everybody else for their input and throw it into the bin. Sounds harsh, but you'll never ship or ship an over-engineered solution, if you'd listen to everybody the same way.

Im going to give you some advice. Only worry about now and the next feature item. Get estimates from engineering and then double them for leadership. Then for sales round to the next quarter. Release you feature to customers a month or so after software development is done with it. Always include starting a feature at the end of the quarter. Build in a permanent buffer into your planning that leadership doesnt know is there. You will reduce your stress levels 800% and engineering will love you.

"I am often the PM that comes up with anecdotes or specific sayings that ends up being copied by stakeholders/colleagues etc., because it gets the message across. Sometimes they will even repeat what I said to me, in exactly the same way as I said it. Which is great, because then I know that my message has been accepted. My advice is try to write what you want to say down, because then you process your thoughts in a structured manner. Also, try to find a relatable anecdote that works. Don’t wait to do your perfect communication in meetings, try out on colleagues before and see what works.

"I think the first thing is to optimise for clarity. Speak as simply as possible but not to the point that you oversimplify and remove all nuance. You can bluff your way through with jargon and big words but this will lead to confusion. At best, people will think you're smart but not know what you're on about. That's not good. So, keep it clear and as simple as possible. Then, spend time preparing how you articulate a point. If it's an important meeting, practice your key talking points. This should put you in the top ten percent, but try to record meetings and listen to yourself. Compare yourself to more eloquent peers. What's the difference?

"As many have said, be concise! Short sentences are more effective. Stop adding prepositional phrases or dead words (“there” “from that perspective” “in terms of” etc). The key to speaking better is to listen to how others don’t speak well. When you tune out of a colleague’s ramble: why? When you can’t follow a point someone else made: why? When you know someone’s point but they keep speaking: why (how)? Speak simply, and don’t be afraid to end a sentence after one clause. Be declarative.

"Are you sure youʻre actually having a problem? People are saying youʻre eloquent, you've made it this far - maybe you're fine! A thing I found helped me was actually explaining to more junior people how to communicate in meetings. It made me turn the way I communicate into templates to follow, which helped me further refine my templates. So maybe look at what you're already doing when you make specific kinds of points. Try to write out a template/formula version of stuff you say a lot - for example, mine were: kicking off a meeting, delivering bad news, explaining why I chose one option over another, getting buy in across teams, etc. Write down the component parts of each statement, see if they look complete and compelling, then iterate, and work on delivering those statements the best way every time. For example, my getting buy in formula looks like: \- State the problem and get everyone to agree on it \- Describe the solution-neutral ideal state and get everyone to agree on it \- State any requirements for the solution that you know the decisionmakers in the meeting care about and get confirmation \- Show how your solution meets requirements and gets everyone their requirements \- Give an accountability mechanism for what you will do if the solution doesn't work or people just don't like it If you've done the research and laid the groundwork before the meeting, you can get through all that pretty fast and everyone's happy and on the same page. Put a few of these together for your most common types of points at meetings and consciously refine them. You've probably already got a few of these, you've just never done it really consciously. And if you mentor junior folks, being able to pass on these kind of templates is absolutely invaluable. They help junior people be more prepared for meetings, they build confidence, demystify your work, and turn ""soft skills"" into hard skills.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-12-07,u/dywk68,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1h7scdl/how_did_you_become_more_eloquent_in_meetings/m0t7ox8/,post: How did you become more eloquent in meetings?

"Not to say that your symptoms aren’t correlated with PM, but those same symptoms are shared by a lot of people as they enter mid-life regardless of career path so I’d encourage you to consider general lifestyle patterns, habits, and stress management in addition to evaluating PM impact. At one point I felt similarly about the desire to have an impact and be proud of my work. What changed is that I learned to deeply internalize and act accordingly with the fact that I need to perform well in my job in order to keep it and advance my career but that the job is only a means to an end — to live my life. Living my life includes hobbies, making great meals with my partner, and doing things I enjoy and give me value. Do not make what you do at work the thing that gives you joy and meaning. Consider Google’s game streaming service Stadia. Hundreds of very smart and talented people worked on bleeding edge technology backed with millions in investment from Google only to have the entire thing shuttered before it really got started. Imagine being a PM working on some key component of it, putting in tons of hours and stressing out about it, and then hearing the thing is ending. Was it worth making this something to personally care about? A job is something you do for income to live — it’s not who you are. Do a good job but don’t make it your sense of worth. Missed deadlines and dealing with stakeholders are sources of conflict and stress. It is possible to learn how to disentangle a) the urgency and need to resolve a problem and b) how you as a human personally feel about it. A stressful problem can simply be a problem that you can choose to be stressed about or not. I’m not going to prescribe ways to solve that problem here because I don’t know your situation well enough but you can absolutely improve this in your life.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-09-23,u/robust_nachos,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1fnnhpn/has_product_management_impacted_your_health/lojoank/,post: Has product management impacted your health negatively?
"1000000% This isn't just PMs but PMs do have a brutal take esp in tech right now. The job market sucks, the role is being abused by really poor leadership and weak product cultures, and generally, most products are complete waste -- things that no one asked for that an internal person requested or was inferred from a customer inaccurately. Most jobs, not even in tech, are paper pushing and middle managementesque. How many payment processing technologies do we really need? The root is all the same: Capitalism caused this. The same way it caused microplastic proliferation and carbon emissions through the stratosphere. We have to fundamentally change our relationship to capital, work, and each other to fix this problem. Not a great answer for this question, but it is what it is. The pandemic brought a ton of introspection and unfortunately for me, not coming from FAANG means retiring or shoveling myself off to a farm is no where near accessible as those who built their career from 2009-2022 and were able to acquire enough equity and spare income to piss off.

"I have ADHD and have been a PM for 8 years. I'm about your age. The job has both given me my highest highs and my lowest lows. In many ways it's ideal for me because I get to juggle different things and build new things. It's also a job where I meet a lot of neurodiverse folks just like me. On the other hand, each place expects something different from a product manager. So I constantly question whether or not I'll be able to make it as a p.m. in my next role. Or feel like I'm going to get found out for being a fraud any minute and get booted. I found my best strategy to surround myself with people that bring out the best in me and or to kick me in the butt when I'm being scared. I've focus on developing the vocabulary to describe what kind of PM environment I want to be in so that I can do my best to avoid places that I don't want to be in or I can't be my best at.

"Absolutely! I quit to recover from the mental burnout…it came to a point where I felt so jaded, life felt pointless since I couldn’t enjoy hobbies outside of work. You would think you just had to put your energy into building great products but that is far from the truth of the overall scope of a PM. That said, I did learn that I needed to be clear on my boundaries at work, learn to care less, at the end of the day we’re all a replaceable cog. Not sure I want to go back to PMing…I’m literally thinking of switching to a career like tech recruiting. For your stomach issue, do you have acid reflux?

"A lot of product management is persuading people to do what we want. Generally we are not the CEO so we can’t just tell teams what to do. We have to convince them we know what we are doing and that they should follow what we suggest. So 2 books I suggest are not specific to product management but instead to dealing with people. __Influence__ by Cialdini - Just an amazing book and will help you in all aspects of life and job. Can’t recommend this was enough. __Color Code__ by Hartman - Unlike the previous book, this one is not written by a professor and it has zero references / sources. The author wrote it based on his experience which is probably close enough to reality that it works. But it ‘assigns’ people into 4 categories and then explains what makes each of those categories work. Once you can identify someone’s category you’ll know how to work with them. This book is most helpful for me to identify colleagues in the blue (feelings and understanding) or red (get this done now) categories and then adjust my approach based on that. Last but not least, for a pure product management book, __Outcomes over Output__ (Seiden) is phenomenal. Plus you can read it in less than a day.

"Hey OP, I'm currently taking #2 GoPractice, have completed #4 Andrew Ng's Coursera, and have watched a few modules of #5 Pendo, so I'll share my opinion of the outcomes I believe you'll get after completing each course. Scenario A: You're unable to explain the concepts of regression, classification, or overfitting, nor describe the lifecycle of an ML model, from training to evaluation to deployment. You don't know how to select an appropriate ML model to solve various types of business problems, nor how to measure or troubleshoot the model's performance. Will taking this course enable you to do all of the above? #2. GoPractice: YES #4. Coursera: YES #5. Pendo: No Scenario B: You don't have strong intuition about how ML regression or classification models work, or about the techniques for how the models ""learn"" (reduce errors). You're also unable to write simple code to implement ML models in Python. Will taking this course enable you to do all of the above? #2. GoPractice: no #4. Coursera: YES #5. Pendo: no Scenario C: You're a PM who has successfully led teams to build and launch non-AI products to solve business problems (but don't know how to do so for an AI/ML product). Will taking this course now prepare you to lead a team to build and launch an AI/ML product to solve a business problem? #2. GoPractice: YES #4. Coursera: no #5. Pendo: no Scenario D: You have zero idea where to begin using AI as a PM. Will taking this course give you jumping-off points to start introducing AI into your product development processes (especially for PLG)? #2. GoPractice: YES #4. Coursera: No #5. Pendo: YES",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-06-16,u/letitialew,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1df0l0y/best_ai_course_up_to_date/l8t6j1l/,post: Best AI course up to date?
"What exactly do you mean by 'beefing up your AI skills'? This would be mean different things to different people (for e.g, a data science person, an developer, a designer etc). What do you hope to be able to achieve after completing such a course? And what do you mean by practical here? Do you want to be to train models by yourself?

"I took the GoPractice course and loved it!!! The thing that I thought was incredibly useful was it walked you through 4 or 5 industry relevant AI/ML implementations and did so from a PMs distinct perspective. It then challenged you at several points to make hard decisions. At each decision point, they provided you things like research papers, frameworks, and visualizations to help guide you to an effective conclusion. When I was done, I realized that I had just built out a step-by-step roadmap on how to build these products myself, what to look out for, and overall how to ensure success. I’ve been adopting the GenAI process to build out an agent in one of my products portal. As a generalist PM, I would have felt much less confident in doing this had I not taken the course.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-06-15,u/Shoddy-Reaction,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1df0l0y/best_ai_course_up_to_date/l8rx29y/,post: Best AI course up to date?

"Lost redditor here, I'm a data scientist, but what the heck I'm alright at this AI stuff. So I don't know anything about you so can't recommend a course. Definitely state your goals, if you don't know what they are my advice might help you identify them. Definitely state your proficiencies so I don't suggest something too easy or too advanced. AI is a big topic, and if you want something translatable to your project management you got to be way more specific. First of all, theory is important you need to read lots of case studies and learn statistics so you don't hinder good statistics but can enable your team effectively. **My biggest recommendation** for you however is to read literature about data mining task project management to guide your course choice. I see a lot of companies applying cookie cutter software engineering approaches which are not too good in comparison so if you have not read the following I think you should really read them for that reason as well: These are what I like, there are other successful frameworks but these will help guide you just as well. [https://www.ibm.com/docs/it/SS3RA7\_18.3.0/pdf/ModelerCRISPDM.pdf](https://www.ibm.com/docs/it/SS3RA7_18.3.0/pdf/ModelerCRISPDM.pdf) [https://cs.unibo.it/\~danilo.montesi/CBD/Beatriz/10.1.1.198.5133.pdf](https://cs.unibo.it/~danilo.montesi/CBD/Beatriz/10.1.1.198.5133.pdf) This can also help you specify what you want to 'beef up' and each of these process components have been proven to be useful for project lifecycles. AI is a big topic, doing it is not just fancy models either you need a lot of skills so its good to see the process laid out in front of you when trying to beef stuff up. As far as actual course recommendations what I can tell you is that MIT Open Courseware is phenomenal for so many different aspects of this process and you will never run out of relevant material on that platform.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-06-14,u/BeulerMaking,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1df0l0y/best_ai_course_up_to_date/l8ketng/,post: Best AI course up to date?
"I have taken courses (2), (4), (5), (6) and (7). While each course has its unique features, the awesomeness of the course creator and instructor etc, I have gotten some insights as to what makes the learning and course participation value added. The GoPractice courses are unique because it is literally case study oriented, learning by doing, and very practical real life oriented.

"I did this course from Deeplearning.ai / Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms Overall I thought it was a pretty solid intro and I feel like I'm at least conversational on the topic and have a sense of what's possible. You get some hands-on experience with AWS Sagemaker but for the most part it's just running a Jupyter notebook and changing some variables to see how they affect things, so you're not going too deep on how to set things up but it isn't purely theory either. Also it's pretty easy to set something up on your own computer if you want to do something hands on.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-06-14,u/BabyNuke,https://reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1df0l0y/best_ai_course_up_to_date/l8iz70o/,post: Best AI course up to date?

Also, the office hours before class are really helpful if you want to just discuss AI/ML questions and trends. If any questions about the course, just comment and I'm happy to answer.

"Definitely true. I was having this very conversation with my boss / the owner of the business this week. I earn well, don't get me wrong, I'm top few % in terms of a UK salary BUT I know and he knows I could go elsewhere and earn much more. Thing is the additional utility provided by money decreases exponentially. So if you're on £20,000, earning an extra £10,000 is huge, but if you're on £80,000, earning an extra £40,000 is great in a vacuum, but doesn't change anything in a meaningful way. I'd rather be happy working for a company I believe in, with people I like, with satisfied customers with mutual respect and good relationships and freedom to work whenever, wherever I choose without being micromanaged",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-11-02,u/Safe_Construction836,https://reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1ghl43o/stop_selling_your_life/luzujup/,post: Stop selling your life

"US companies are just delusional with their success sometimes. For example - they push a half baked product and either pay reps a lot to sell it, or they just pay ok, but whip their reps to death to sell it. Reps figure out a way to make the product fit the customer needs (with a dash of “it’s on the roadmap), and just get shit done. Then the shitty product teams and daft leadership all celebrate (behind closed doors they think “wow, we might actually have something here”) and eventually buy into their own bullshit. The reality being that, at least most of the time, the product isn’t all that great but the sales reps know it’s do or die. So many bad products have lasted longer than they ever deserved to thanks to good sellers. Watch the BlackBerry movie for a fun dramatization of this. They WERE good, then they blew it.

"The vast majority of sales people are not making this kind of money. OTE they are doing anywhere from 150 to 275k once they’ve been at it for a while.

"Fellow ex-car sales woman, here. Love this story! I sold Buicks 1989-1991 in Culver City, CA. I was a fresh college graduate looking to make a buck and answered a sales ad in the newspaper. It turned out to be incredible professional / life prep for the people practice. My best up was a slovenly looking dude who shuffled onto the lot in flip flops and a shirt that was two sizes too small. The up wasn’t mine but Charlie, my colleague, says “No way, no how. I ain’t wasting my turn on this dude”. And he tossed it to me, the new girl. The guy wants to test drive the red two door convertible Reatta on the showroom floor. Now this is a hassle in and of itself because one has to actually get furniture moved and the showroom doors opened and no one was happy about it and Charlie was laughing his head off in the corner. Protocol called for taking a photocopy of the drivers license so as I walked to the copier, I noticed his last name was Hearst. Yes. A grandson of THE Hearst family. After a successful test drive, he wrote a check for list price and drove home same day.

"While this is good advice, it's not advice that I personally followed and I don't regret it in hindsight (I'm 47 now). I started my first sales position right out of undergrad in 1999. I did very well and two years later purchased an E46 M3, later sold that and bought a 2004 B6 Audi S4. Bought my first condo in 2005. Was maxing out my 401K the entire time but beyond that had very little savings or other investments. I was a car guy when I was younger (belonged to different BMW/Audi groups etc.). Saturday mornings were spent detailing the car followed by tooling around. Life for me at the time was essentially working, gym, cars and women. I didn't get married until 36. Wife and I own a place in San Francisco now. Have 1 car between us (a Subaru outback that we bought with cash). While it's hard to recommend paying a lot for something that is essentially your biggest depreciating asset, I'm glad I got it out of my system.

"Yeah . . . Man, I get the frustration when a boss seems to underappreciate the team, but there's a lot about your post that makes me think you need to take some humble pills and get back to work. $400k sales budget for the month means about a $4.8M sales budget for the year. Assume 50% gross margins, so your owner has $2.4M left in gross profit. He's paying salaries and bonus for 14 people? Let's call that about $1M in comp, benefits, and payroll taxes for the year. So, your owner has $1.4M left to pay for rent, insurance, utilities, marketing activities, interest, fuel, office supplies, and everything else for the year. Good for you for beating budget last month, but believe me, a one-timw $100k sales vicotry is not making your boss sleep more soundly at night with everything on their mind. How's your YTD sales trend? Are your expenses coming in under budget? Overall, you need to understand that when you sell $100k more, the owner of the business is not making $100k more as you seem to think. Congrats on crushing it last month. Keep up the great work.

Good write up. I think an added outlier driver is being diversified on your offering. If you are in a position to sell different solutions or different pieces to your business that helps tremendously.

"When you say ""sales"" you mean tech sales, which is very product heavy with with very large numbers, and it has long and infrequent sales cycles. For this reason, the traditional dynamic of one sales rep guiding the whole sale cradle to grave becomes very risky. ""Fred and his tropical shirts is a hell of closer but he missed a crucial closing call thats been 4 months in the making. The client won't talk to anyone else though, Fred's been working him this whole time."" The business relies on these big contracts so it is much safer to align the sale with the product and have systems that divide up the process among more reps so that no sale is completely reliant on one guy (hence the high churn). So in that context yes the sale relies less on skill and more on the product and the systems that you help move forward. Gentle nudge - Saas is not ALL sales. Sales does exist beyond Saas and before Saas; as did business development, etc. So you can't leverage personal touch over product, for sure. But you can leverage a strong skillset to present the product as superior and in a more impactful way. You can create a bias where the buyer hopes you have the best product so he can work with you. Not specifically directed at OP, I have no idea how long you've been at it, but to anyone else; you're not going to have a full grasp and depth of sales in under five years. Even though it seems like you've seen it all, there will be things that don't click for years.

Slowest company to respond to market changes as its top heavy, every regime of execs changes the way you play yearly. Zero investment in customer success unless you’re advocating for your customer as a rep. Shit timing and territory lol. No wonder I can’t sell! How do you win over a prospect when your service is just as good or worse than competitors, and MORE expensive?? Personality and customer service isn’t enough.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-07-07,u/barnyarden,https://reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1dxgflc/80_of_your_sales_performance_is_impacted_by/lc2tlg0/,post: 80% of your sales performance is impacted by external factors that you have no control over

I worked in sales in UAE. One thing I noticed was that C Level execs often had female 'secretaries' who were actually decision makers. I ended up pitching a lot of Secretaries and when I would finally sit down with The C levels (presumably after the secretary told them my product was worth looking at) they didn't seem to want to know much about the product but more about me as a person - probably to see if I was trustworthy. I'd never get a straight yes from C Level then like a week after meeting the secretaries would call me back and just take whatever my recommendation was. They never haggled for discounts or anything. So Secretary decided on need for product then the boss sussed you out and the Secretary placed the order for whatever I recommended. I also dealt with Indian companies - good luck there ...

"Second gen Indian here, so I know the culture well. Primarily they view most things as commodities, therefore alternative exists and you're just one option - they'll naturally try to get the best perceived value knowing they can just go elsewhere. Best approach is to de-commoditize your product/service and be explicit why your offering is unique. If you can successfully do that, they'll be a customer for life AND send everyone they know your way, often time already convinced the other prospect that you're the real deal. Having said that, you still need to qualify them for: want/need/afford first just like you should with everyone. True commodities won't work with them. For example, if you're a lawn maintenance company, there is no way for you to truthfully de-commoditize your service and they'll see though your BS. Also, relationship based selling won't work in commodity based product/services because they know, and let's face it, that relationship is more beneficial to the seller, not the buyer. So true commodities, only way to win is volume based on discount and referrals generated based on that discount.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-09-21,u/deja2001,https://reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1flvayi/i_hate_to_say_this_but_does_anybody_have_any/lo6ymg0/,"post: I hate to say this, but does anybody have any advice on how to do sales with Indian/middle eastern people?"
"I used to sell cars for a living, so as soon as I saw a family of Indians get out of their car I would go to the bathroom and hide out for ten minutes until some other salesman upped them. Saturday's are their main days to shop since they work long hours during the week, but Saturday's are a car salesman's best day to sell, so you wouldn't want to get into a 7 hr. marathon negotiation with a family of Indians. I've watched it too many times, I would sell two or three cars in the time that the other salesman spent with the Indians. I usually made anywhere from $500 to $2000 for the day while the other salesman would make what we call a mini, which could be anywhere from $150 to $250 for the sale if there is one.

"There is much more to this than cold calling the CEO for them to refer to other buyers in the organization. I love this process, but in many cases do must top down/bottom up to sell in. For example, If you have been working his/her team and the leadership team has ignored you, told you no, etc. then your process may fall apart. Why is that? Leadership referrals from the CEO are typically told to evaluate this or asked what they think. They then have the very easy task of evaluating and saying this does not work for what you (Mr or Mrs CEO) are looking for. You are then dead in the water and have no where else to go. This is typical if you’ve gotten a no elsewhere in the organization. Conversely if you have not met with the leadership team and starting from scratch, the CEO/CxO can be a great lead-in. I believe this is your point! Going back to the place where leadership can kill your initial engagement. I’m assuming you find out if there is a specific business need the CEO has that your product/solution aligns to his/her initiatives. Then you have followup that can be used when the decision maker kills your sell-in because they think (or know 😀) the solution won’t help them save money, create efficiencies, grow the biz. I love your commentary and would just take it one step further to help the broader group that they should understand their solution can easily get killed in the process elsewhere by leadership and should be conscious of that.

"I’m an engineer and feel this. I’m also a salesperson, and a very effective one. In some ways, you’re hitting on the reason but you don’t understand it fully. Most people have opinions based on superficial beliefs, takes, observations, and other aspects. There is no real depth to any of these opinions and so can be easily swayed. In other words, they’re relatively easy to sell to. Engineers tend to have a much deeper and generally well tested set of truths that constrain every decision they make. The depth and breadth of these constraints are often far beyond most other people and what a typical salesperson is willing to explore with them. You will also find that this type of person is very willing to fully explore their decision landscape with you if you were so inclined, assuming that the subject matter is worth spending their time exploring. In other words, the sales process is not going to be quick with an engineer, and you better be talking about something that they have a vested interest in understanding more about otherwise they’re generally not going to be willing to take the time necessary to explore. I sell mostly to engineers, and I do it in an effective way that works with engineers. As a result, I benefit from a close rate over 80%. Have a product that engineers tend to care about, be willing to spend the time exploring their underlying biases, don’t overstep, overstate, or be incorrect (ever), insert new information at the correct moments in a non-polarizing way, show how and why your product / service provides benefits along the dimensions you’ve discovered are important to them, and you will sell your product at a very high rate. Simple. In short – go deeper. The other option is to avoid this type of person altogether if you don’t want to take the time and effort to do so, because you probably won’t be successful if you don’t do what I’ve framed up above.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-10-05,u/LukeC_123,https://reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1fwv662/i_cant_stand_engineers/lqhmc36/,post: I can't stand engineers
Am sales engineer - can confirm that I’m a really bad customer. I only make decisions based on rationale and logic. Never in haste. But I also sell to other engineers and it’s a completely different level field - engineer to engineer. When both parties get into the weeds and details because we have to - it creates trust and relationships. In my opinion much better sales process. Sorry to hear about other engineers that are sticklers,,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-10-05,u/MalfunctioningSelf,https://reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1fwv662/i_cant_stand_engineers/lqhu4mu/,post: I can't stand engineers
"I had two engineers spec a circuit for an electric motor based on LRA as opposed to RLA. Had to explain to both of them what the difference between the two and remind them about how electric motors work. In the end, they were still reluctant to believe me. I couldn't believe how electrical engineers didn't understand the simplest principles of what they were supposed to know. Maybe it's because I'm in Canada and we are over run with terrible engineers? But I agree, engineers are so dumb sometimes that having a straightforward conversation with them is impossible. The only thing that works is helping them maintain their illusion to their customers.

"Fuck the PIP. If you do everything they ask. You leverage all the tools and have a great relationship with your customers. It’s likely the manager. 30 years in sales. 17 roles. 15 open doors and cell numbers of ceos and presidents of some of the biggest brands; PIPs are two ways to get rid of a lazy employee. Or a means of a manager moving on from an underperforming sales reps. (We all know managers who give donkey quotas and then ask why you’re not hitting the number) If your manager isn’t having a one on one, discussing LY $$ and asking you for your Growth. Stretch and GAP plan… the manager is useless and an ExcelSpreadsheet queen/king. Story about the one time I was given a PIP: I was given a transfer from one province to the next because the President of the company, wanted to keep me. Newly married. Moving home. He then asked me to report on the business based on my experience with the other branch. I gave it 100 days and submitted my report. (We were a lighting Distributor) Branch went from 30m to 8m. In 5 years. Then from 8-3 prior to my arrival. It was a cliff. Their saving grace was a huge infrastructure project with buddies of the manager aside from that. Nothing else. Staff were all legacy employees mailing it in. So no new business was coming in. And I called it out. His buddies got to cherry pick and I had to go in on mopping duty after they’ve fumbled the ball so many times they pissed off all the nationals in the area. For obvious reasons The branch manager and his regional manager buddy had it out for me. President loved me. I resigned. Did my exit interview. They tried to get me back. Fired the manager, restructured regional and mid level everything. I said thanks but no thanks as I have a philosophy to never work for the same employer twice. But always maintain that relationship.

"Uh....I always feel like I am in control of the interview. I get what you are saying, but I also don't think that is a great strategy. If you are going to work directly for the CRO, then sure, but I am going to guess as someone posting here, you would not be. I've been on both sides of the table. Why not play the game? In the grand scheme, it is just douche personality. It might never affect you. Sure it is possible it greatly affects you as the CRO burns the company down, but let's look at plausible and likely. Why not let him suck himself off, you laugh and agree. Not like you won't be doing that customers, your in laws, or future execs anyway. Play the game, get the offer letter. Then if the job is worth it, figure it out. Ask your future boss what he thinks about the CRO. Ask him they friends, etc. You are now in real control by having the offer letter and not accepting yet. Again, what you did is fine. I am just saying I don't think it is the best tactic. Lastly, I understand exactly what you mean. We are all different here.

Affecting the attendees is much cooler than impressing a potential employer. You could do this by sharing your specific knowledge of how to get into and remain successful in tech sales. Public speaking gigs should be considered a whole different world than tech sales. You could consider it PR or Marketing for your own brand. Most companies only care about how well your vision aligns with their own.

"I was at at&t. Lead for an internal product that is critical for the day to day function of the company. They gave me that mandate close to 2 years ago. I told them no and continued working as always (my entire team was 4 states away so makes no sense to come into the office). A year later my boss puts me up for a promotion for over producing, got a fat bonus. Vp took notice and wanted to meet me and asked what days I come in to which I told him none. Less then a week later I was in a meeting with hr. Being given an ultimatum. I told them to show me where in the last year has my productivity suffer by being at home. They didn't care so I told them to screw themselves and quit. It's been a several months now, they have called me multiple times to ask if I can come back. They even offer for me to come back as a contractor which were not under the rto mandate. Told them nope. Only way these dumb ass companies are gonna learn is when their systems hurt. I keep in touch with my old boss, they are really hurting now because after I left, half the team left and only the poor juniors are left. Beauty of all this is that when they gave me the mandate I went out and got another position with a company out of California that didn't care if I was remote or not. So for over a year I enjoyed having almost 2.5 times the income and gave me the space to not give a damn what at&t wanted to do.

"Let me tell you a story. Few years ago, friend and myself were working in a luxury yacht company - regional dealership for a world known brand. We were ""sales"" people on the paper and to be honest we were making the best money in the company so we never wanted management positions. Now, after a few years, as usual with management changes, we got a new CEO to whom we report directly. He's a nice guy, but when he realized how much we were making, he wanted a piece of the pie. It all started when he began reaching out to our clients behind our backs, offering them discounts we couldn’t match, even though the company would lose money. Keep in mind, these clients aren’t your typical sales clients; they’re incredibly smart and wealthy, and they quickly caught on to what was happening, and since we have great relationships with them we found out soon after. Well, we spoke to him and told him to stop, but he didn’t listen. The next thing he tried was getting close to the dealership, but you know how it is—guys from the main dealership visit us a few times a year, and the sales guys are cool; everyone wants to hang out with us. We made sure they had the time of their lives during their visits—nights out, alcohol, hookers, drugs, you name it. Plus, we made crazy money for them, so they loved us. After a few months, we found out he wanted to get rid of us, confident that he could handle sales on his own with help from his cousin. Long story short—we both got terminated, but we took all the clients with us, took over his dealership, and started our own company. He had to shut down his company six months after we left. Be careful with sales guys; we’re not just selling stuff. My advice would be to sit down and have a conversation with him. Don’t start by telling him your concerns about him—ask him to share his issues, what he would change, what he needs, etc. Be a snake, my friend.

"Im in your exact opposite scenario, I’m currently in government and looking to transition into tech sales. I’m early 30’s and wrapping up a part time MBA. I just want to provide my perspective and see if I’m crazy. A few things I struggle with in government are the lack of incentives for high performance, slow promotions, slow-paced work environment, bureaucratic processes for decision making, and obviously the lack of cash compensation. I’m fully vested with 9 years of experience, and I could retire before turning 60 with a very nice pension.

"One of my really good friends is a prime example of this. He’s now a senior manager so doesn’t sell anymore and I worked with him for 10 years on the phones and his entire career is mostly luck. He joined the company at a time when the industry we cover was absolutely booming and anyone with a pulse could do well. Things started to slow down 5-6 years but because he’d built up a good reputation he was moved to another area that had been struggling. A few months in a former employee calls him directly asking him to come in for a meeting. This led to him winning the biggest contract in our regions history just because this guy who he got on with in the office moved jobs and thought of him when they needed to buy. After that he was quickly moved into management and no longer has to sell. He’s a genuinely nice guy so whilst I’m happy for him I’m still somewhat jealous.

"Luck is when preparation meets opportunity, as it’s said. The consistency of doing at least a good chunk of what you should be doing daily or monthly, being capable, and actually learning/growing from experience over time is going to make lucky.

"I try to workout each day. It’s not easy. Usually I get up at 515am’ish to get a good 60-90min of exercise and stretching before the kids wake up. I also use this time to watch something educational to start the day right (currently trying to learn about day trading stocks). Then I separate and try to be fully present for my family. When the kids are off to school it’s work time- thinking strategically about my long term goals/objectives then figuring out what I have to do today to get me closer to my goals. I try to take a few breaks during the day (I’m not good at avoiding social media but I’m working on it) to keep me fresh. Definitely have a snack or two. Also, i quit coffee- too many ups and downs. I drink lots of water and my energy is solid. When the work day ends, again, I try to be present. Often times I’ll get back on the computer at night to take care of busy work I couldn’t do during the day. Weekends I don’t do anything for work. Not sure if that helps but I’ve been making six figures for a while and it’s been a healthy pressure of growth and achievement, but I also don’t take it too seriously- being present and focused, whether work or personal, is how I cope.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-05-30,u/xxxz23zxxx,https://reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1d4dphk/how_many_of_you_are_earning_100k_and_have/l6e9vw1/,post: How many of you are earning $100k+ and have good/great mental health?

"Like others are saying: eat right and exercise. I'll add limit caffeine and alcohol intake. I stick to no more than 20 oz of coffee per day. Alcohol no more than once per week. Unplug when you get home as best you can. Turn phone on do not disturb. Or at least set it to silent so you're not checking it every time it vibrates. Personally, I set aside Saturday and Sunday for family or relaxation time. We also take plenty of small vacations (3-day camping trips or short weekend getaways). And a few full, week-long vacations as well. I work for myself, so I'm not earning money while away from work. However, time off prevents burnout for me and for my family.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-05-30,u/OZKInsuranceGuy,https://reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1d4dphk/how_many_of_you_are_earning_100k_and_have/l6e8nms/,post: How many of you are earning $100k+ and have good/great mental health?

"I (40m) go to Crossfit 5x a week along with 2x per week of strength training. I run a few times a week. I don't drive my car - I bike almost everywhere. I work from home and live just a few blocks from my gym. I'm also on a volleyball team and am an avid hiker and outdoorsman. I also pet my dog - a lot. With food, I used to be vegan but have recently started eating small quantities of meat again due to not being able to keep up with my protein requirements easily. Almost no fast food and very limited restaurants. Alcohol maybe once a week in limited quantity. Some casual weed gummies every blue moon. I don't overeat and don't eat trash. It makes for a very visible 6pack when combined with the gym regimen. I'm happily married to someone I respect and trust. We are childfree which is probably the biggest thing which makes our lifestyle ""positive and physically healthy"". We both work from home which allows for a very active lovelife. All the exercise helps with this as well. We also travel a lot which is great. I spent half my year in South America this year. Most of this is doable because I own the sales firm I work at. This means that I don't put up with shitty clients. I also don't keep shitty salesmen very long. I only work with people I like almost all of the time. Not having a boss is a big plus. I work mainly with space companies and military contractors so the work is really interesting. Overall life is grand right now.

"Dude, this sounds so relatable. Wish I had that kind of motivation all the time. When you're job hunting, it's insanely easy to spiral into self-doubt. And worst part is getting no feedback. Or just negative stuff. And that's exactly what happens - you're working full-time (sometimes more), and the silence is brutal. Totally messes with your head.

"0 — Evaluate your priorities. Please lock in. Eliminate all of your social/extracurricular activities (unless they are directly in alignment like sports for exercise or something) for like…5 years. Think of yourself in 10 years. Think of yourself on your deathbed. What would those versions of yourself want you to do right now? 1 — Get a job. I hear you about the hospitality industry sucking, but there are so many back of house jobs that pay you to do something easy & repetitive and not have to deal with (so) much bullshit. Just get whatever position you can get yourself to every day, without having to rely on anything but your feet, your bike, or the bus if you have to. You will be in a much clearer headspace if you can at least pay for your food & basic necessities. (Another perk of working in the hospitality industry…you have to try really hard to starve.) 2 — Look up Earn Your Leisure in YouTube. Watch all of the videos from the beginning. Make this the only thing you do in your free time. While you’re working your shitty low wage job, while you’re exercising & not going out and blowing money on dumb shit). I know this is an entrepreneurship thread but 18 is young AF and you NEED to be *investing* the biggest chunk of income you possibly can, & leaving it completely alone. If you do that for the next 15 years, you will still be YOUNG AF and in a hugely better position to live the rest of your life comfortably.

We sell it for about $20,000 a piece, but also take payment plans where you put $10,000 up front. 10-15 sales will get you to the 200k mark so you don’t need crazy volume.

"i’d suggest focusing on the product only. its design, production etc. and hire a small team to look after the rest like marketing, production and sales etc. Build an empire. be it a small one. it doesn’t matter. it could be just 2 people. but, BUILD. A. TEAM. if you do all by yourself, you’ll have everything sorted but won’t be able to scale and eventually you’ll come to a dead end where you either won’t have time or money. As an entrepreneur, i’ve learned it’s always better to trade money for time. you can always make back money if you accidentally waste it on a bad product, or a bad marketing team, or a bad production team. but you can NEVER EVER make back the time you’ll waste by, let’s say, not doing enough to push a good product? or maybe not searching enough for a skilled team to help you out. so it’s actually best to invest money and save time. if you really want to go big with this someday, focus on being the boss. the one who creates the best product. and then works with the best people to market their product. you don’t have to invest millions. but you HAVE to invest. this is where i’ve seen most people go wrong. if you make it your habit to invest time instead of money, you’ll have a hard time escaping the mindset “oh i can probably do it myself” and trust me, it messes things up. as a digital marketing agency owner, i’ve worked with many clothing brands from US and UK. The ones who solely focused on the product and its production and let me and my team do our job, just made 6 figures this black friday. and we signed them up 3 months ago. and the ones who thought they can do it themselves, (no hate to them i wish them all of good in this world and i hope they soon are skilled enough to do what i could’ve done for them) only closed at a few thousands at max. Point being, just focus on YOUR JOB. Your job is to make the product. explore what is something you can do to make your product unique and valuable. hope this gives you some good perspective :)",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-12-04,u/DifferentApple7021,https://reddit.com/r/Entrepreneurs/comments/1h6bhtz/what_skills_should_i_focus_on_before_starting_my/m0d24zu/,post: What Skills Should I Focus on Before Starting My Clothing Brand?

The real root cause to me is not fixing the configuration issue for everyone since you’ve dealt with this with multiple customers already.

"Former pro brewer, beverage director, and hospitality man here. Tangentially related business owner now. Don’t open a brewery, especially without formal experience. I’ve been a part of a couple dozen brewery buildouts in the last 7 years. 80% of them have closed. My business isn’t specific to brewery equipment, but necessary for a brewery to function. The amount of people that “own” a brewery that produce between 0-100 bbl a year is insane. There were 923 active breweries that produced 0 bbl 2023. There were 5,178 brewers that produced <1000. In most scenarios, producing <800bbls makes it nearly impossible to be profitable. To be active you must have your brewers license, have passed inspection, and be “operating.” The margins are poor, especially without having a restaurant attached. Distribution is rough for newcomers, and at your version or “small,” you will make so little on a keg that it isn’t worth the gas to deliver it. Hire yourself out of your business and train them on your customer service. You may think you are the magic sauce with your customer service at the event, but you can train that easily. Buy and start a second trailer. Put a third in a nearby market (~3 hour drive.) Keep going. Get a scrappy newcomer to run sales on a heavily commissioned basis. Keep going.

"DON'T DO A BREWERY! The market is so oversaturated right now, it's entered a period of consolidation and microbrews are dropping like flies. A new brewery would almost certainly fail. That's not to say you shouldn't investigate it as a hobby, or even a hobby that finances itself where you can sell the product through your beer trailer. But the market conditions for a brewery is just awful at this point in time. Please reconsider at least the timing.

Friend of mine that was in an auto related business did the same thing last year. A much larger company came in and offered him an obscene amount of money for the business that he had started 25 years before. The number was so large he couldn't turn it down. But it came with a non-compete and he isn't allowed to do any automotive related business for five years anywhere within 250 miles. Took a few huge vacations and now is helping his adult children get set up in a business of their choosing and acting as their advisor.,,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-12-28,u/AZPeakBagger,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1hnyik9/sold_my_business_yesterday_crazy_feeling/m46l81q/,post: Sold my Business Yesterday....

"My family and I own a Pet Grooming business, we are strictly brick and mortar and prefer that business model even though we could potentially and easily add a good chunk of revenue to our business. Honestly it’s just that we prefer not to have the risk. We get clients all the time asking for Mobile, I have a local mobile groomer that I refer to all the time, she probably gets 3-4 clients from us a week consistently, in turn if she gets somebody who doesn’t want mobile or she’s super booked she will refer to us. We’ve been doing this with each other for 6-7 years, and honestly it’s been fantastic for the both of us as clients love to see it be more of a community rather than a cutthroat field. Honestly, the working relationship is so great that last year when her van broke down she called us low key panicking and I just told her: Look, don’t cancel appointments, call your clients, explain the situation and see if for this one appointment they will come into the shop. They’d rather have you since you’ve been their groomer for years than the convenience then I’ll just give you space to operate in our shop until your back on the road. And this year my sister got hurt and the mobile lady would come in and help us on busier days once she was done with her few appointments. Obviously we paid her and when we helped her she rented a booth but it was less than the commission structure we have for employees, both deals were more than fair for both sides.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-07-19,u/SiggySiggy69,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1e6inan/just_landed_my_biggest_sale_ever_thanks_to_my/ldvkcl3/,post: Just landed my biggest sale ever thanks to my competitor

He had started a year earlier before me and he was helping me out in all ways. Gradually even I started helping him out in his installations . Since we wer around 15kms apart, our leads were not much in common, and even if he we got common leads, we mention the prices that we quoted to the customer and who ever the customer calls second time, we undercut the rate and wer able to close the deals. Last year our distrributor had announced a scheme , were in we need to bill a certain value to be eligible for an all paid trip. We knew we couldn't close the scheme individually, so we both started billing in his name and closed the scheme last year.

It depends. The younger workers that I have worked with tended to think that managers made a billion dollars a year and that everyone else was getting the short end of the stick.

"So, I'm a car wash owner (in bay automatics and self serve bays) in a smaller sized market, that had a multi milion dollar new tunnel car wash open literally about 500 ft away from us. It was stressful leading up to their opening obviously. But, we knew we put out a great product. In anticipation we focused on any issues we may have been lacking. We bought the empty lot next door so we could put in all new vacuums. We added new paystations that allowed people to purchase monthly memeberships. We put a new LED sign out by the road to advertise our ""brushless automatics."" We did all this prior to the opening of the big new shiny tunnel.... We had our best month at that location we'd ever had, the same month that tunnel opened next door. While they were giving away free washes and trying to force feed their monthly memberships. Point being, if you're confident in what you do, invest in your business to improve anything that you may have taken for granted before.

"I definately understand your frustration. My business does $1.5 Million in revenue and 1 client who has been with me since day 1 is 98% of our revenues. Luckily our operation us very automated and I have been able to go back to my Full time career while running this on the side. I realized this year that I'm putting all my eggs in 1 basket and restrategized to start bringing in additional clients. However, my goal this year was to show my #1 client that they needed me and how much I contribute to the efficiency of their sourcing and ensuring their core product is available while dealing with the problems for them so they can focus on their core operations. And it worked. Hoping in 12 months that I can reduce them to 75% of my revenues.

You’re understandably anxious.

Unless you actually know what you’re doing in terms of the mechanical and fabrication side as well as the marketing side, I would recommend continuing on with your current education. For the award sector to work you need to know how to manufacture your product to a high degree with as little expense as possible, and sell as many of them as you can. This means having five or more accounts per month purchasing 10-20 pieces per account. Usually with upsells like engraving or nice solid stone bases.

"My 2 cents... I think you're making a nostalgic, emotional decision rather than one with your head. It's probably got a lot to do with your parents being unwell and saving the shop might feel like your way of controlling a deteriorating situation and bringing things back to how they used to be. But ... things will never be the same whether you manage to turn the shop around or not. Likewise, saving the shop isn't going to save your parents' legacy. Their legacy will live on through you and whatever you decide to do with your life - and what type of person you choose to be as you live it.

"Buddy who falls ass backwards into money called me once to invest 50k in one of his hairbrained ideas. I passed. He spent a few hundred grand on plain old brand new Ford trucks and hired yahoos for like $250 a day each to fill the beds with all the waste (destroyed houses, furniture, etc.) from Hurricane Katrina. FEMA was paying $2,500 a DAY per crew. He had three guys per truck and was grossing like $1,750 a day per crew. After gas and shit he cleared 1500 per truck per day. He got up to 30 effing crews, making 45 grand a day, and the work lasted almost three months. That dude absolutely raked, and never did a lick of work. Afterwards, FEMA was selling hundreds of mobile homes (they planned them as evacuee shelters but never used them) at pennies on the dollar. Literally $50k trailers for $2,500 cash.

Guys with no money would drop $12k on a treatment that maybe worked for 50% of the patients. The original owner had one or two successful clinics. After a few years, he went nationwide, expanding rapidly into all major cities. He sold the company when it started to go downhill to a couple investors.

A lot of businesses can make a killing. Had a friend who lived on a ranch. It was his dad’s ranch that he only used to store equipment. There was a really bad fire nearby and they were worried it was going to get to the ranch so my friend went out bought 5 string trimmers a chainsaw and a front loader. Hired 5 guys from Home Depot to clear out all the brush on the ranch while he dug out a fire break with the front loader. People saw what he was doing and asked him to do the same to their land. 1 year later he had 3-4 trucks full of guys doing the same thing. All he did was drive around quoting jobs all day. Eventually I think he even hired someone to do that.,,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-05-27,u/0RGASMIK,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1d1rlvc/what_business_were_you_a_part_of_or_saw_first/l5wjyqz/,post: What business were you a part of or saw first hand that made an absolute killing ?

I don’t know a lot about that industry, but I guess back in the 70’s when it was started they were one of the few companies around that could provide that. That ended up taking off in the 90’s within some specific manufacturing spaces and they capitalized by buying companies in related spaces. I can’t even tell you have many tens of millions the owner takes home, let alone how much profit the company is making. It’s all privately held.

We would go through 10-30 bags of potatoes per day per stand. Hardest part about that industry is all the good spots at fairs are taken by the people that have been doing it for decades.

"I used to work for a corp that bought privately owned small medical practices. These Drs were getting ready to retire, so basically we bought the practice, kept them on for a year on a nice salary and they got to have their swan song year with their patients. Sometimes it transitioned well, others not. What was alarming is how many Drs had paper records they had been keeping for decades. Some struggled with email. It was typically an accounting nightmare. Most of the Drs really had no idea how much money they made. Records were wrong . It was bad. There was never a case when we were shopping a practice that the annual revenue they reported was actually correct. It was almost always 20-40% lower. Just because someone had an amazing skill whether it’s. Medicine, technical, or any other skill, it doesn’t mean they will be a good business person. It’s a different skill set. I have found most small businesses would more than pay for a good manager or leader to run the business , while the owner focuses on the skill that the business revolves around.

"Just ignore her behavior and worry about the job. If you’re interested, then tread lightly. Keep distinct boundaries between business and personal relationships. However, you can successfully manage both if you want it. I became friends with a female customer over a period of nearly a year. We talked about the latest restaurants every time we saw each other. One day we talked about one particular restaurant we wanted to try. She referenced that because of the size of the place, it was more of a date setting rather than a friend group-dining place. She also referenced she wasn’t seeing anyone. I suggested we go together and that I would make a reservation if she was interested. It took two months to get a reservation at the restaurant (which we both knew beforehand). We went on a bunch of dates before our dinner reservation to deepen our friendship.

"Like everyone else said, this is textbook fraud. Cease operations immediately and talk to a lawyer. Get a franchise lawyer, not some lawyer you know. Specialists here will help you immensely. But also, talk with the landlord, tell them (don't ask) that you're shutting the store in the meantime and see where the books stand on the lease/back rent (sounds like there probably is some) etc. They might not care, but you'll need this paper trail. Also talk to the franchisor immediately, BLAST THEM. Blast the area/district manger, talk to every single franchisee in your market and tell them what is going on. This is brand damage, and everyone in the brand should know about it. If the zor was so fucking terrible at oversight, that is a major, major problem. If they were involved in the sale, it's far, far worse. It could roll up to FTC violations and get their ability to operate in your market pulled completely. You and your fellow zees need to ask them what exactly the fuck they are doing to earn their franchise fees. Lastly, do not contact the prior owner. I know if I were in your shoes I'd want to kick down their door and pry my money from their cold dead hands, but resist that urge.

"The issue with the employees is it's own thing- the previous owner might be a shit, but unless he sold the business with some kind of condition that promised compensation if key employees resigned or missed time I don't see how there could be opportunity for recourse for you. If the previous owner stiffed customers prior to the sale date... hopefully your purchase contract outlines when you assumed liability pretty clearly (i.e. any liability from prior to purchase date is the old owner / anything after purchase date is new owner)? In the event the previous owner is liable because your purchase contract outlines such, hopefully they're also responsible for legal fees? What about ""hold harmless"" clauses? With the number of businesses suing you really need to get a lawyer involved to review your purchase contract and assess your liability/exposure. What the previous owner did certainly sounds like theft and maybe conversion, but it all depends on what your purchase contract outlined as far as requirements for disclosure, obligations and liabilities. If there was something in your purchase contract that required disclosure of all assets and liabilities, and the previous owner effectively ""cooked the books"" to make himself look better and make a final cash grab... he's liable but you'll have to chase him for it. Get a lawyer, don't mess around with this. You likely need a litigator, there are business lawyers who focus on contracts and then there's the lawyers who have experience going to court. Get the lawyer with experience going to court because that may be where you end up, and it sends a message to the previous owner that you're not messing around. Additionally, your lawyer may send a letter threatening to notify groups like the State Attorney General for the unethical business practices or the IRS if the former owner didn't pay taxes properly could inspire the former owner to write a check so you can fulfill the orders.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-08-22,u/michuru809,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1eyjwba/husband_bought_a_business_that_turned_out_to_be_a/ljdroak/,post: Husband bought a business that turned out to be a scam.

"Talk to a lawyer ASAP. You want to not only recover your invested capital, which would be nice but unlikely, you want to avoid SURETY for the fraud that was done to the customers. For this, I’m guessing, your lawyer will look to do what’s called an UNWINDING of the purchase and sale agreement on the basis of fraud. Unfortunately, you’ll likely have to administer the business while this is happening. DON’T put a single dollar of your own into the business from here on out. Get a CPA to handle all transactions in accounting from this point forward AT THE DIRECTION OF THE BUSINESS’S ATTORNEY. The worst thing you can do at this point is anything at all on your own. You need to have the business ATTORN the business out of your control.

"Years ago my dad made equipment for a meat processing plant. But the increase in capacity meant that they needed to ramp up the farms to produce more or add more farms. So both the equipment and the ramp up would take a little time. So the company and us had made a deal. Signed PO. 30% down of the total. We began producing the equipment. Invoiced for that first piece of equipment in full when delivered, installed, and accepted by the customer. (Payment in 20 days after acceptance.) They paid 50% of the invoice for that individual piece of equipment. (We told them to short pay the full invoice. ) Next piece, same. Invoiced for total for that piece and they paid 50% of that amount upon acceptance. Next piece and so on Once all pieces were accepted, the remaining 20% was due within 60 days. (Invoicing for the delivered full amount now made it a receivable. Bank really liked that for financing. Accountant loved it as the balance sheet looked great. Client liked it as they could hold some back to ensure performance on the whole installation. The 60 days was so they had time to work out any issues and adjust procedures in consultation with us.

"I do something similar to you. Been doing it about 15 yrs. Solo for 3. I’ve dealt w orders of every size - some as large as $25M. I think most folks don’t understand how payment terms/financing work w manufacturers. So you’re getting a lot of advice about how to collect money from your customer without a way to pay your supplier. Also, in the products world we don’t really use escrow. Typically we use letters of credit - similar but no insurance underwriting it, just the bank. A LC from your customer should also allow you to get financing from your bank. Create a schedule over time. Depending on what the part is, I doubt the factory can make 13M parts that quickly - just a guess. And your customer likely doesn’t need all of them at one time or want to store them all. You can set up a series of waterfall payment between your customer and the factory to cover deposits for materials and pay the balance as goods ship/based on the schedule you work out w the manufacturer. The first order delivers and you collect your money. Meanwhile more is being made/shipped. Figure out, based on the schedule, how much money you need to front at any given time.

back when i had a pc repair shop i cut off a customer. we talked on the phone and she insisted on paying $20 less than my normal price but i refused. when she was supposed to pick up her pc her child walked through the door alone with a check written for the amount i had refused on the phone. rather than argue i just took the check and promptly cashed it. next time she called for help i politely reminded her of what she did and wished her the best of luck with her problem. she begged but i refused. i would be lying if i said it didnt feel good.,,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-12-10,u/Leofus,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1hasiio/just_cut_off_a_customer/m1cdx0g/,post: Just cut off a customer
I had to turn down few clients as they are abusive to my employees. I realized that you will always have good clients who value your service and integrity of your employees. I will stand by employees no matter what. I want my employees love coming to work and know that their employer values their service and hard work.,,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-12-10,u/picinthepic,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1hasiio/just_cut_off_a_customer/m1b88kl/,post: Just cut off a customer

"I had a customer like this that I had to get rid of too, she left me a scathing Zero star review on yelp even though I had already done a bunch of free work for her and drove back and forth out to her house to put up NINE different paint sample colors on the wall, after having had purchase all nine sample quarts myself. She also had a handyman that was supposed to texture a wall and install baseboard before I started the interior repaint. On his start date he texted me and said that he wouldnt be going back there and that the customer was just too tough to work with. This screwed up my schedule even more. I didn't have a signed contract with her or anything, I just decided to eat the cost of paint and labor it took to spray the baseboards out in the driveway so that the handyman could install them, which never happened. Anyways, I walked away to give my full attention to other customers that I DID have contracts with, and she still gave me zero stars.

"The Pareto principle applies to customer relationship management. 80% of complaints will arise from 20% of your customers. However, out of that population of dissatisfied customers there is another 20% that will absolutely waste 80% of your time and generate no profit for the business. These are the customers that will never be satisfied no matter if you give them the sun the moon and the stars. They will always use anger and abusive behavior as leverage to extract as much value out of their relationship with you as they possibly can. If you waste your attention and energy on these abusive customers, it will be to the detriment of your relationship with your other good customers.

We've refused service on a few customers over the years by saying that we feel we just can't live up to their expectations and they should shop elsewhere. I've been genuinely amazed at how many have said that they actually don't want to go elsewhere. That's then given us opportunity to explain that their behaviour ( constantly returning products for store credit or exchanges) is unacceptable and unsustainable. Its like telling off naughty children and bizarrely most have agreed and have continued to use us with no further problems!

There is no explicit agreement that the order is complete when the product is “in-hands”. If it was stolen, that is not your responsibility. You might try and compensate your customer, but it’s not required. If they file a chargeback on the payment for the reason: Item Not Received.

"Congratulations! As a full time entrepreneur, I strong advise spend a few hours per week applying for jobs, even if it’s a part time job. 4 months goes by incredibly fast in start up world and you should not deplete 6 months of cash trying to launch something that isn’t getting traction. I’m just saying, to be safe and extend the longevity of your launch, try to find a gig that’s 15-20hrs/week.

"So either you don’t know the law or the city employee doesn’t know the law? If it’s the former, talk to someone who has done what you’re doing. If it’s the latter, continue to hound them until you get a more clear cut answer. Although it sounds like your city doesn’t allow it and you just have to make do. If your business was truly profitable in your home, figure out how to expand your marketing and sales efforts to support the added overhead cost of renting a kitchen. Come up with a “pre-sale” item that is a month or two out (Halloween pretzel rods, pumpkin cake, pumpkin-shaped pretzels, pretzel-shaped pumpkins). Garner some local clout and use that as confidence to take the next scary step. This will close your business and leave you back at square one, if you let it.

"I'm not trying to cause confusion here, especially since I don't know a dam thing about home food processing, but it really does sound like there has been some sort of miscommunication. According to the North Carolina Department of Agriculture website, it does look like this is permitted. If you read all the way through this, it doesn’t even look like they will issue a permit, nor does it look like you even need one. All it looks like is that you need a copy of the inspection report, which they issue after the inspection.

Maybe they heard ""high risk"" when you said ""low risk""? This looks like a situation where you need to double back and have another conversation with them. Come with your facts lined up and the regulations in hand, highlighted and marked up. It may even be a good idea to go to an office and have a face to face conversation with them. I am in a highly regulated field, and I have run into all sorts of misinterpretations and misapplication of regulations. Remember, the people you are talking with, are people, just like you and I. They make mistakes, misread, and misinterpret stuff all the time. Just be very nice and treat them with respect, and you can get a continuing conversation.

"What are your city rules on food trucks? Could you buy/rent a trailer and put an oven and table in it? Then in the short term bake pretzels out of the trailer until you can afford another space or maybe even move to a full food truck operation or both. Used enclosed trailers can easily go for $2k to $3k or even see if someone will donate or borrow one for a time. Doesn't have to be in good condition, just enough to call it a mobile food truck. Not sure what all you would need, but installing a simple vent/fan,.oven, and table would get you most of the way there.

That is my role in this, not everyone can do it but I could. However she came in blasted out of her mind one morning and I sent her home for the day.

"My daughter is in recovery for both heroin and alcohol, so my experience is anecdotal and not personal. In my observation, most addicts take several tries to get and stay sober. For my daughter, it was around four stints of 30 days, then a year, then a couple of years, and now she is nearly 8 years sober. A lot of getting there depends on the trauma they are self medicating from, their drug(s) of choice, their support system, their access to recovery care, and then just circumstance. I would never hesitate to hire someone who was sober, but also I would be very alert and ready to cut ties if necessary. For someone newly sober, it is likely that they will relapse. Sometimes this is immediately recoverable (meaning, they slipped but quickly got back on track and didn't inflict any interpersonal, physical or financial damage), other times it's going to be awhile before they manage to get back on the sober bus. It's possible to be kind and human but also have boundaries and not allow your business to be impacted. I will say that the people who genuinely helped and gave chances and didn't let her get away with shit, even if it meant firing her or excluding her from a social circle, are the ones she respects and appreciates. They mirror to her that there are good and helpful people, and what happened was her mistake, not theirs. This is an important part of the journey.

"LONG: Recovering Addict (with multiple felony convictions) here. I am on both sides of this situation being both a business owner and addict in recovery. My opinion is that MANY Business Owners, Entry Level/Restaurant Workers, Executives, Board Members…are either abusing substances, alcohol, gambling etc currently or in the past. It is naive to assume the majority of the workforce has their act together. I stole and committed forgery to support my habits on top of working 60 hours a week as a cocktail server. However, this was over 13 years ago but it is still on my record, easily found on Google searches and I am open about it. To this day, I am looked at differently by some people; immediately mistrusted and dishonest in their mind. I cannot change their opinion of me no matter how well I am doing, no matter how much time passes or even when I prove myself to be honest and trustworthy consistently. I served my time and paid my debt to society. I got caught and I have a record. Just because a person doesn’t have a documented criminal history does not mean they are any different than the ones who do. P.S- In NYS, there are Tax Incentives for hiring felons. Prior Felons are also eligible to be ‘Bonded’ as an incentive to hire felons. Meaning if you hire a felon and suffer losses related to this employee, you will be reimbursed. I’m not sure of the details on the Bonding process. It’s always a risk hiring *Anyone* but I personally feel that addicts in recovery are hard working, learn from their mistakes and are more open to improving themselves and to feedback because it is a huge part of staying sober. Also, helping your community by giving a job to someone who has few options. Keeping one less person off the street and contributing to society instead of judging based on someone’s mistakes. Sometimes you’re going to get burned but that is true of all employees you entrust with your business. Sorry this is so long!

"On my farm, we often employ homeless and addicted folk. We pay cash because they don't have bank accounts, and those check cashing places are abusive.

"The CDC makes a bold claim that 75% of addicts ""recover"".

There comes a point where ""second chance"" is actually their 105th chance and no, they don't deserve it because addiction or no, choices are always made. I say that as a recovering addict.

"I used to work for a company that was started by a recovering addict and one of his biggest claims to fame (he was written about in numerous entrepreneur magazines for it) is that he tried to hire exclusively recovering addicts of one way or another, I think that the entire sales staff were recovering alcoholics or addicts, most everyone else was not but I wouldn't be surprised if there were. To me, after working there for about 2 years, it felt like the sales people traded whatever addiction they had previously for being addicted to money, they all were fiends for the next sale or even the little games that the managers played to boost sales (it was essentially like a boiler room but was not selling stocks). It was an absolute pain in the ass as an IT systems admin, every single email that came in they ""Have to open this email, it might be a sale"" it didn't matter if it 100% was an obvious scam, they had to click on every single email, and being that they were sales people pulling in all the money for the company, if ANYTHING didn't go their way, they went straight to the owner and he made everyone give them whatever it was that they wanted. Edit to add: except for a handful of people most of the sales staff were not THAT bad, but there were enough of them that were absolute raging a-holes and they all seemed to become the leads or managers, most of the new hires all came in and were fairly nice, but it felt like after a while the more senior people would rub off on them eventually, or they just couldn't handle the situation after a while and they would either relapse or quit for something less stressful.

"I somewhat disagree agree with the general consensus on here. Just because you said no tax doesn’t necessarily mean that there isn’t tax. What’s to say you aren’t covering the taxes, in a sense giving them the tax amount as a discount? That is a common practice around my area, whereas the furniture store or car lot offers to pay your taxes or advertises no taxes. I don’t think it is a clear case of tax evasion; especially if you haven’t filed your taxes. Therefore you haven’t evaded anything in the first place. Bottom line is that you’ve yet to be paid, so any tax collection, whether paid by you or them, is nill at this point. Since there are no contracts between the parties, other than verbal, your intentions (whether true or not) are unknown. Again, as someone mentioned earlier, it really boils down to what state you live in for law purposes. The real question to me is whether or not your friendship is worth destroying?

"In a creative business, I learned early on to never ever offer those payment terms. It is the fastest way to kill your business before it starts. Cash flow is the lifeblood in a design business. I used to get paid at the end of the project and then I went deep into debt. Now, I ask for money up front. Nothing happens until the invoice is paid. Full stop. I require payment if they want me to start thinking about their project. I don’t say that, but it is the subtext during my closing statement in an introductory call. Do they “want to do X? It will be $Y and I will deliver it in A-B business days”. Maybe they want something less specific such as a desired outcome that is not easily quantified; “well in my experience projects like this typically require an investment of $XXXX - $XXXXX. Are you comfortable with that?” When they say yes, I button it up and let them know when the invoice and agreement will arrive and I verify they are ready to move forward. Qualify your potential clients to filter out the tire kickers and low ballers. Raise your rates, get money up front to plan your projects and scope them properly, get their buy in, and set them up on a recurring payment cycle.

"For creative projects that aren’t retainer-based, I always require a 50% deposit before the project is placed in the queue. This covers most of my costs and motivates the client to promptly provide any assets needed to start. I’ve had 2–3 clients frustrated over delays in starting their projects, but this approach has been extremely helpful. I also make sure to clearly communicate the deposit policy when presenting pricing. I always mention it verbally and ensure it’s bolded and marked with an asterisk in the proposal. That said, invoicing and dealing with unpaid invoices is where I struggle most, especially with retainer clients. Larger companies often route invoices through AP (Accounts Payable) departments, so I try to establish direct communication with AP contacts. However, even then, some simply don’t respond.

"The only thing I can say is that, having experienced the failure of an apparel business up close, if you need to keep running ads to move your product, you don’t have recurring customers, therefore you don’t have a good product-market fit, and your customer acquisition cost becomes unsustainable. Kids and baby clothing segments are notorious for this problem because even if you delight a customer with your product once, children are very fickle and grow up fast and secondly, your product user is not the buying decision maker. To answer op’s final question - Unless you are in business to change the world or to do something that has never been done before, the measure of success of an entrepreneur is money in the bank. There are plenty of cushy corporate jobs that put in a lot of money in the bank with a fragment of the work an entrepreneur would have to put in. To make your way to those jobs takes a decade or so of work, so it isn’t easy either, but once you are there, life is comfortable. Paid vacations, insurance, corporate perks, money in the bank like clockwork. The main difference between having a job vs having a business is that there is no limit to your earnings with a business.

"I’m in a similar situation. Just bought an existing business for $190k buying inventory and closing costs were an additional $90k. In for a total of $280k. The numbers they showed me showed a profit of $7k per month with owner working 20 hours a week. I have a full time job so I knew I would have $2000 more in labour. So $5k in profit. After I got into the bank account and pos system I quickly added stuff up and realized that they were making $1k profit not $7k Now I am 2 months in. Lost $1200 per month plus $1600 in interest payments per month. Fortunately I have a job that pays me well so I can service the interest but need to get the store at least breaking even. I am going to give it 6 more months to get the sales up. I have increased inventory. They had been running it lean. I think they lost customers to not having products in stock. Came up with some promotions that seem to be working. Bringing in more customers but then the profit margin is lower. If it doesn’t work in 6 months I either need to close it, sell it, or move the business. This will be a big loss that may take me 5-10 years to pay off.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-12-09,u/Chance_Preparation_5,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1h9ww1l/im_141000_in_debt_after_chasing_big_dreams/m14fdb0/,"post: I’m $141,000 in Debt After Chasing Big Dreams.

It seems like you are missing some of the skillset required in your business too, maybe you need a consultant or coach. Even failures as horrible as they seem are learning lessons.

"I worked retail loss prevention in my twenties. Here's my advice: You're going to need to make some changes. 1) Greet all customers as they come in. Make sure its not just a quick hello from your corner. If people walk in- make the effort to walk around. You don't have to invade their space but make them aware that you are actively present. 2) Invest in cameras. I didn't see you mention reviewing footage so i'm going to assume you don't have any. Cameras will allow you to identify responsibile individuals in the future. Invest in dummy cameras if you are on a budget. You've probably seen those dark domes in ceilings when shopping. Its common that at least some of those are fake to save money. These visible camera domes are a deterrent when people know they might be watched. 3) Absolutely do not confront this child. First they are a minor which complicates the whole issue, secondly it doesn't sound like you have any proof. Being accused of theft is not a small matter and you better have either watched someone pocket/leave with an item or better yet have it on video. Perhaps instituting a policy of no kids allowed without an adult might help you.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-04-26,u/GeneralOrchid,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1cdvcg6/little_girls_stealing_what_do_i_do/l1embc9/,post: Little girls stealing — what do I do!?
"Very very common these days. I can tell you what Sephora does as that’s where my own middle schooler stole some stuff. They let the first one or two times go and let her get away with it. Have her on camera. The third time a loss prevention guy stopped her at the exit and made her empty the stolen stuff from her bag. Had the kids wait in the back office until police came. Police call parents, write a report and with the store issue a no trespass to the kids (they can’t come to the store again or will be arrested.). Kids can clear their record if they do community service , write essay apology and take an anti theft course, drug test etc. I’d contact your local police to see what you can do, But I kid you not that anti theft course I took my daughter to had 50+ other girls there for the same shoplifting crime all of em know each other.

"First, you need cameras, if you do anything wrong in this type of situation you could very easily end up with your whole community turning against you.

I'm not mad at you, I just want to know the truth."" What do you hope to accomplish with this? Most likely she is going to lie to you, and you are going to look bad, but even if she doesn't you aren't her parents, most things you do or say in this type of situation are just going to open you up to a whole bunch of liability not actually help the girl or her situation, even if you are well meaning.

"As others have been saying, without irrefutable evidence, I wouldn't do anything. Buy some cameras and adjust store policies accordingly, such as no bags in the store, warning signs that premises is under surveillance, etc. Confronting her may not play out the way you have in your mind anyway. The girl could deny it. In which case what do you say? Where's your evidence?

"My question would be, what amount of business do the girls account for? Have you just become the after-school daycare? Do the parents account for any of your business? I would guess the kids do not justify the need to allow them in. It's your business, and you have to run it the best way for you. It is absolutely not uncommon for stores close to schools to have rules like "" All minors must be accompanied by an adult."" There are a number of reasons you should have that sign. Theft is one thing, but if they hang out in your shop, they become your liability. If you post it on your door and then kindly let them know that they are more than welcome to come back with their parents.

"I have had a couple issues in my store. My store, in part, attracts a younger crowd as much as the older crowd. I use Wyze cameras and have them everywhere, and I pay the fee to store video. Unless you have video proof, I would not make a thing of it. Also, be 100% sure if you ever do confront someone, not even 99% is good enough. I had a young lady (early 20s) steal some magnets from me before. I had it on video. I posted the video and still images to a local popular Facebook group saying, if anyone knows who this is... I received a call from that young lady within 2 days and she came in balling and paid for what she stole. I could have called police, but took the road of ""parent"". I had a teen steal a necklace from me. I was watching on video at the time because she was acting strange - and I was 98% sure I saw it, but that's not enough to confront. On her way out, I did say, ""Sure you aren't interested in a necklace today?"" She replied, ""Oh!"" and went back to look at them (odd), and brought up a necklace and paid for one. Strange... so I looked back at the video, and sure enough I saw her 100% steal one. I closed up my shop, walked around our small town and found her, walked up and said, ""I want the one you didn't pay for."" She stared, then dug in her pocket and gave it back. She was arrogant about it, so I probably should have called police (yes, yes, I know the ""she's young!"" but if they're never scared straight...). With Wyze cameras I have mine ""grouped"" so that I can watch in a grid - it helps for watching suspicious kiddos. Highly recommend. I also have what I call ""fly traps"" that I use. Example, I set out cheap stickers in a bin at the back of my shop. I'm sure some have taken some, but that's the point. If they get off on the rush of stealing... I'd rather them steal my cheap stickers that I bulk order off Temu vs. something of more value to me.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-04-27,u/BlackMetalMercantile,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1cdvcg6/little_girls_stealing_what_do_i_do/l1ixv8b/,post: Little girls stealing — what do I do!?

"So, I'm a freelance graphic designer and writer who works in the board game and tabletop RPG industry. It's mostly two things that I see repeatedly: 1. They cannot communicate effectively via text. This happens so often and it should be surprising that these people also write rules for games. However, when you read their rules, they are often just a hodgepodge inarticulate mess that needs someone to explain further. When I recommend they either have me rewrite it, or they hire a technical writer, they slowly blink and the hamster burns out. 2. They think they have a unique idea that someone will steal. They are often little more than ""idea guys"" who come up with something they think is unique and want someone to implement it for them. More often than not, it is just a horrid mash-up of two or more other game systems that are already popular. I've signed more than a few NDAs that people insist upon before they will even tell you their plans, and then when they throw back the curtain, I have to tell them that their plan either already exists as another game, or that there's some legal reason they can't do it (like using Pokemon).

"You're essentially selling your company to your customer. You need protection in case after purchase they decide to fire the manager, you. Because they have managers, they don't have skilled employees. So, take this in two separate steps. 1) selling your company and 2) hiring you as a manager. You sell your company generally as a multiple of your profit plus the value of handing over a working team already knowledgeable about their business. (Calculate the NPV of the cash flow generated by your business.) The value they're seeing is saving the money they're paying your company less the cost of the labor and material they'll have to spend. The value you see is the profit they pay you plus the profit from the other 20% of your business, which they won't see. So there's a difference in value there. You sell your time as a manager at the market rate plus a kicker for already knowing all the employees and track record of successful building a profitable company. Since your business is probably in a different market than their's, an NDA would be reasonable, but a non-compete wouldn't. This way if you get fired, you can start again with plenty of capital from selling your company. Keep your options open. Get value today for the value provided today.

"My rule is that if you start doing more that 30% of your business with any one customer you business is starting to be at risk. Your team is clearly valuable, but this ends one of two ways. 1. You are absorbed into the host company and no longer have a company. 2. You sacrifice all other business opportunities to work for the host company then the host company decides to cut costs or employees and you eventually end up being fired and have no other business. The question you have to ask yourself is ""Do you want your own company?"" if the answer is yes, this deal needs to be structured as an outsource deal. If you don't care about being absorbed into a larger company and losing your business get a good contract with a golden parachute in case things go sideways (which they will).

For those who don’t know: plasti-dip is basically liquid rubber and was used to dip tools like screwdrivers in it, to give it better grip and insulation. The nice thing about it is: once its dry and cured, you can just peel it off, it doesn’t bond with the actual paint. Long story short, guy did it and spray painted his Audi in matte white if I recall correctly. Some people in the forum called him an idiot, telling him he is a tool for Spraypainting has car and ruining it, completely missing the point that this is a temporary, peelable layer. Long story short: dude contacted the manufacturer and got an exclusive deal to market plasti-dip as temporary car paint in the tuning scene. 9 out of 10 times you see a tuned car with a wild paint scheme, it’s probably been „dipped“.

"Budget sensitive customers are sensitive for a reason, and when you engage with them you are supporting those sensitivities. Most of the time it’s intangible to the provider (you). It could be that they are struggling, cash flow issues or any other combination of typical business struggle. Their investment in your service is therefore of higher consequence and risk than a larger customer. This translates into customers that micromanage, push for free services and, unfortunately, poor behavior for those that can’t manage their constraints effectively. I have a simple policy for this: The first time, I let it go. The second time, I let them know. Third time, they’re fired. It’s a simple “no jerks” policy, but you have to confront it. In some cases, transparency with them will give you clarity on the underlying reasons and you can find a happy medium. If not, then they’re a bad customer and like a bad employee they will drain your business. If you don’t have clear policies on what you will and will not do, then that’s priority 1. Document it, communicate it and make it clear to your customers what those boundaries are. Otherwise they’ll exercise whatever control they can to get as much as they can, and no services business can prevent bad behavior from customers; you just need to be able to identify when the line is crossed and deal with it.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-09-08,u/WatchYaWant,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1fc3zdj/why_does_it_feel_like_clients_who_pay_the_least/lm5i9pr/,post: Why does it feel like clients who pay the least always require the most?

"There are levels of “business owner” and this is what you’re experiencing. The newer business owner, the super small business owner, the “hobbyist” business owner etc., often don’t know how to have a good relationship with vendor yet. As someone who owns a marketing agency but also owns a medium sized B2C business, I’ve seen both sides. When we hire a freelancer to do a project, we don’t whine and complain. If they suck, we just don’t use them again. But we’re never mean and never demanding. It’s either a good fit or it’s not. But I’ve seen a lot of these super small business owners, like the ones that pay $600 /month for marketing, just don’t have the experience to understand how manage a vendor. Like someone else said, that $600 means more to the little client and than the $2k does to the larger client. At our marketing agency, we recently had a failure on a $6k /month client. Couldn’t scale their ads profitably. Guess what? The client thanked us for trying, said he appreciated our effort, and said we could holler back if we had any new ideas. It honestly made our team feel way worse about failing, because the guy was just a great client. We don’t fail often, but no agency gets great results 100% of the time. This client understood that. These are the types of clients you want in a marketing agency. Good luck!

"This is definitely a thing. There are the demanding customers who always want things yesterday and for a low price. Usually they only want to pay when they are fully satistied, or they dispute things. No matter what you do, at best you can temporarily satisfy them. To a level that *they* still feel *you* can be happy they are paying you. They are not going to refer you, ever, because they aren’t truly happy + you having less time might be bad for them. Very often all of the above is the same person. Yet there are also customers that start out happy, trust you do the right job, will genuinely be happy and will recommend you in a heartbeat.

They think it's already overpriced and are annoyed that they can't get it for even lower - results in a salty attitude - They have someone above them who treats them like trash, puts pressure on them, and they aren't good at their job, and not treat you like trash because of their mistakes The realist is, if you actually do need the money, it sucks because you will end up putting up with it.

I know that they feel they paid a lot of money for this product and so paying me to repair it they will expect a better product than they bought originally. I have stopped working with these people.

"""I’m having trouble wrapping my head around taxes."" That's all you had to say. You realize you don't understand it, but then you try to dissect it with your fuzzy math. I know it just baffles you how $400k/year turns into $4k/month. First off, it doesn't matter how much revenue you bring in. You could have $3million in sales and still net $200k after expenses. If you want to improve your net income, then analyze your expenses and see where you can improve. Can you look for cheaper supplies, can you negotiate for better pricing from vendors, etc. I don't know where you came up with that 40% tax. That could be what you're sending to as quarterly estimated taxes or setting aside for taxes, but that doesn't mean that's the amount you actually owe after filing. Your main taxes are Social Security, Medicare, and federal income tax. You didn't mention if you get a large refund or owe more. If you really want to see what you pay in taxes, look at your 2023 tax filing. Where you lost me is when you say you pay yourself a $50k salary when your business nets you $200k. You're setting aside $5k to grow your business. If you need that $5k for the business to survive, then it's a business expense then it shouldn't be counted as taxable income. So if you can really only afford to pay yourself $4k/month then your margin really isn't 50%. Perhaps you really don't understand how taxes work and you actually do have a good business. But there are many cases with owning a business doesn't make sense at the end of the day, when you only make $50k/year and work 80 weeks. There's the old saying that goes something like, ""I was tired of working 9 to 5 for someone else so now I work 24/7 for myself.""",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-10-11,u/mydarkerside,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1g19q39/i_feel_like_taxes_is_making_my_business_not_even/lrfp61y/,post: I feel like taxes is making my business not even worth operating anymore.

"Everyone is saying a good CPA. That's solid. And by CPA we don't mean general tax preparer. Nevertheless, my inclination is that what you really need even more urgently is a bookkeeper. Often they will work together, even in the same office, with a CPA. I'm getting the impression your frustration is less about tax strategy and more about you not understanding where your money is going. In my opinion first you have to understand where your money is going and then understand tax strategy. If you want to do the work these are things a person can learn to do themselves, but it is a LOT of time and work. And somewhere between understanding where your money is going and understanding tax strategy, I'm betting you are going to find some holes where money is being needlessly drained away or at the very least poorly understood and accounted for, at worst outright thievery.

"Revenue is a core indicator of your position in the market. If you are running a business with comparables (i.e. any business you've ever heard of) then margin and expenses issues can be fixed with good management. The difficult thing is often getting customers to buy your product. It's an external factor.

"Revenue tells you about the size and scale of a business more than profit does. If you are doing $5M in sales, it means you have found a market, there is an audience that wants your products/services, and you have figured out how to reach that audience. Whether your profit is $200k or $2M on that is at that point more of a function of how well you set your pricing and run your business. Revenue also tells you more about growth and future potential of the business. Whereas if someone just says “I have $1m in profit” it could mean anything from a well run small business with limited growth potential and a lot of founder dependency to a large and growing business that’s plowing most gross profits back into marketing. Of course neither number tells the story on its own, and even with both numbers you’d still want to see the trends over time, but maybe this gives some idea why revenue matters to some folks.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-09-04,u/gc1,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1f8ybil/why_do_business_owners_always_mention_revenue/llht0mm/,post: Why do business owners always mention revenue?
"It’s completely normal for a small or growing business to have smaller net profits. Growing the top line is a valid business strategy with the goal of tightening things and significantly growing profit in future years (e.g., Everlane).

"it is pretty common for businesses to talk revenue. It is a valid benchmark as business owners tend to be able to gage how their business is doing based on revenue(we know what our operating expenses are and what our margins roughly are I'm sure I'm not alone when I think about monthly deposits(in part because I have to pay sales tax) and while gross profit is what's really important(or what a person nets) there is nothign wrong with business owners thinking about revenue If a plumbing contractor lands a big job they'll say....""we just secured a 1.2 million dollar job""...there is nothing wrong with that and most people realize how things work. of course they have to make sure that htey make money on the job and banks will always care more about a companies P&L's than revenue but people talking about revenue is not bad. If a buddy of mine owns a bar he'll talk about bringing in 7k in revenue on Saturday night. There is nothing wrong with that. Of ourse he has to pay for the product and labor and of course the operating expenses and band but we all get that(most of us in business do anyway) He doesn't say....i made 900 is gross profit on Saturday... so of course a restaurant owner cares about revenue and for me I'd be interested in my competitors revenue as I can compare it to mine.

"You're absolutely right, revenue without profit means nothing in the long run. So many people get fooled by the big numbers, since revenue is gaudy and easy to understand, but it's not the complete picture. Net profit and cash flow-what matters. That shows the health of the business. High revenue with thin margins or crazy expenses just gives an illusion of success. They celebrate big revenue on Shark Tank like everywhere else, because that really shows demand and scalability; but like you said, without profit, it's all smoke and mirrors.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-09-04,u/SMBDealGuy,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1f8ybil/why_do_business_owners_always_mention_revenue/lli8mnu/,post: Why do business owners always mention revenue?
"For me, revenue is a point of pride Yes, net profit is the important number but, if in discussion with somebody, it doesn't really indicate the level of business. Saying 'this month we made 5k profit' may require defensive qualification. 'This month we only made 5k, but that's after operations, original stock cost, payroll, packaging and shipping, subscriptions, VAT, corporation tax, accountancy and legal, general expenses, etc If I'm selling a product for £10 and say I made £1,000 this month, one may conclude that I sold 100 units this month. Referencing revenue, rather than net, just gives a clearer indicator of the amount of work I'm doing and acts as brand proof. If somebody asks you how much you earn, in a 9-5, you generally provide your salary, as provided on your contract, not as you receive after taxes, national insurance, pension etc unless specifically stating 'after deductions' I think a lot of answers here make a lot of sense and are very logical, this is just a little addition for some more personal reasons I'd do it, assuming that most people that would be asking this are friends/acquaintances that aren't business owners.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-09-04,u/Upvotelution,https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1f8ybil/why_do_business_owners_always_mention_revenue/lliimpq/,post: Why do business owners always mention revenue?

This is a good retrospective. I don’t necessarily agree with #3 though. Sometimes you solve a problem that people don’t know they have yet (pain relief not a vitamin). Unfortunately that takes a ton of work to educate the market/customers. I’ve been there. My first startup - back in 2004 - had this problem.

"I am having a really hard time understanding how a company can have 10M monthly revenue, 1000 employees and still need investment to keep a float. I also worked in another company in the same financial position. I just don't understand how you can run a business that at that size is still not profitable and keep investors around.

"I've worked at a startup from the ground up like you, there were four of us engineers and two founders. Several years later the startup's valuation is in the nine figure range. I thought everything was exactly how I wanted. The company even did really cool and fun tech stuff. Over the next few years, I was let go, lost my best friend, got an expensive divorce and a fight for child custody. Going through stuff like this, it really sets you back and has you reevaluate what is important. I'm starting up another business and hearing hour you mention giving back, it really resonates with me. Being able to truly give back, to help better other people and their lives, that's where I really want to put my focus in life. One of the things that I can relate to is the feeling shame and wanting to hide from everyone. I realized that only I get to curate the self image I have of myself. There are parts of my life that I'm not proud of, and those are small parts of my life that happened to me, but aren't who I am. I don't repeat those things, or allow myself to be in those situations again. It's like I have set that of who I was down, and let it become part of my past. That part took a lot of thinking and introspection. It was like a puzzle that took over a year to figure out, but when I did, it was like a light switch and things started changing with my perception almost immediately. I'm still definitely figuring things out, and getting my direction back. One of those things I would be interested in hearing is your morning routine, and even your night routine. I'm stuck with the feeling like I didn't get enough accomplished during the day and I'll keep trying to do more at night. Do you have any tips on routine? Like what's made your morning routine intense? Was it the strict rigidity, the types of activities in the morning, or the strict adherence? I would be interested in discussing this with you.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-10-21,u/ElvisT,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1g8nfky/from_running_a_350m_startup_to_failing_big_and/lt2advg/,post: From Running a $350M Startup to Failing Big and Rediscovering What Really Matters in Life ❤️

Hire a reasonably low cost lawyer , who can read up the law , find the right clauses that resonate, like stealing business information , unauthorized content recording and more , that forces and prompts them to respond , and repeated reminders with escalating public disclosure . Plan 3 levels - 1 legal notice 2 legal notice to MS incubator + Wharton as well 3 press and public release or all the above + file in court ( some court ) figure it . ( do all this legally , so you are not caught out with a defamation suit ) 2. Get smart , if you have spent 4 years building , and they are competition, what can you do to get to market quicker / customer onboarding ? 3.

"Sorry to hear about this. Understand your frustration. ""All your good ideas will be copied; it’s just a question of when. Competing only on features results in bullet-point battles; this is the weakest way to win sales. Creating bigger and more emotional distinction is a powerful way to win, and breaks us of the habit of believing that incremental product updates will dramatically increase differentiation, or growth. Here are some extreme questions from Jason Cohen's blog to help you win against such situations: If our biggest competitor copied every feature we have, how would we still win? Is the answer inside our product, in something other than the utility of the features? What is that, and how could we make more of that, so we’re differentiated even in the face of a copy-cat? Is it ease of use, ease of sharing, pleasure of great design? Is it building the next unique feature so quickly that no competitor can catch up (since in this hypothetical they’re just copying us rather than being insightful on their own), and if so, what is the killer next feature that would leap-frog us from a customer’s perspective? If the answer is outside of our product, where is it? A higher purpose or brand-promise that our customers buy into, aside from the product? Is that because we are good at communicating how we make the world better, or because our customers are “rooting for David against Goliath,” or how our culture is special, or because our brand is distinctive (even if just “it’s the best” or “it’s the biggest”), or because our customers trust us, maybe because of our customer service, or because of how we handle situations that go poorly, or because we “give back” in forms like open-source or community-building or significant philanthropy?""[Read full blog here ](https://longform.asmartbear.com/extreme-questions/)",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-06-10,u/External_Remove_1227,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1dcqnlg/unethical_behavior_and_my_ip_what_would_you_do/l7zt8b6/,post: Unethical behavior and my IP.

"You’re doing great. Feeling stress, fear, uncertain, etc are all normal. You’ll get more comfortable being uncomfortable as time goes on, and you/your partner tackle things together. I suspect a lot of the fear comes from uncertainty as this is your first time. There’s no certain path, but one thing that may help is finding someone that’s been through it before to help guide, prioritize, etc. They can also help with taking a step back to work on the business so you avoid avoidable mistakes.

My cofounder also went through something similar. My best advice after watching her struggle - get help asap. Either by hiring full time or look for an experienced contractor(s) you can meet however you need to go over the overall situation of the company and can act as a neutral third party between you and your cofounder to help you make decisions and act with confidence. We have various now that we work with that fill certain niches that help tremendously and they are only in contract for a few hours a week. Anything from HR to SOC2 to UX/UI design.

"It’s great to hear that things are going well now. I think you have two options that could help you moving forward: 1. If you trust your developer enough, you could offer them the role of co-founder. This would involve giving them a percentage of the company, decision-making power, and all the responsibilities that come with being a co-founder. 2. If you don’t know them well enough but recognize they are a great developer, they could be your first employee with some special clauses to make it attractive for them, and so you don’t have to pay a salary in the early months. For example, you could create a plan with them on how long it will take to launch the product (e.g., 2 months). Based on that, you could agree to 4–6 months of work, with payment starting from month 5 or 7. If paying a fixed salary from the start isn’t possible, this could be a viable alternative. Regardless of the agreement, I think it’s crucial to offer them an attractive compensation package—perhaps equity in the company—so they understand that if the company grows, they’ll benefit significantly as well. This will go a long way in ensuring their commitment, efficiency, and speed of development.

"I can really relate to this story on a personal level. I’ve been there—wanting to move faster, thinking I needed a “big, shiny” solution to get things done quicker. But looking back, I see that I almost sabotaged my own progress because of impatience. I’ve learned the hard way that finding the right developer is like finding a good partner—it takes time, trust, and communication. When I’ve tried to rush the process, I ended up wasting more time and money than if I had just stuck with the person who understood my vision from the start. In my case, my original developer turned out to be the best decision I made, and we’re finally close to launching. But getting there wasn’t easy—I let impatience get the best of me, and it almost cost me my startup. So, to any non-technical founders out there: *Don’t make my mistake.* Stick with the people who get you and your project, even if progress feels slow. You’ll save yourself a lot of stress and money in the long run. And one more thing—learn as much as you can about the tech side. It’ll help you make better decisions and manage your expectations.

"My rule of thumb when working with contractors is to never risk more than you are willing to walk away from. If you don't want take time to manage your contractor and you are willing to walk away from $70k, that could be OK in the right circumstances. The same applies when doing work for customers. Don't do more work without getting paid than you can afford to walk away from. I sometimes order custom stuff from China. For relatively small orders, the Chinese won't ship until you pay in full. I spend extra to get samples shipped to the US. Then, I place an order for the amount that I can survive if something goes wrong. I recently had a similar situation with a contractor working on a clearly specified electronics design project. We had weekly progress billing. After a few weeks, I noticed that he would start emailing and chatting about all these great things he was going to accomplish just before the billing date. I also noticed that the tangible work product was lacking - not much progress and lots of lack of attention to detail (which seemed odd for EE). After $10k and several days before the next billing period, I insisted that he send me all his designs immediately. I could understand enough of what he sent me that I could tell either he sucked or he wasn't really working on the project. I told him he could either make things right on his own time or that our contract was over. He did send over one revision, but it was lame.

"$70k is not at all unreasonable for 14k of something.

I'd set my pricing closer to $120k for something like this, if not $140-150k.

Normal option grants vest over time, with the most common non-executive structure being a 48 month vesting period including a 12 month cliff vest.

"I don't know about normal, but there are a number of questions I would have in your shoes. I'll just lay them all out as rhetorical questions. What happens if you want to leave and there has been no liquidity event? Do you void your equity compensation? This could create a perverse incentive to never hit the liquidity event. You could be misaligned from day one and never discover until you want to leave. If you have to cash out on exit, is there other compensation? Or do you get to sell your options/equity considerations? If so, who can you sell your shares or options to? How is the share value determined? 15 years - good chance they have used this equity payment style before. How has it played out for the employee? Or are there just a bunch of staff that have been underpaid for a decade? What is the target timeframe for this equity incident? If they're still bringing on people with equity offers, it has to be at least a year, right? Maybe 4? So now we're looking at 16-20 years... It's a long time. How healthy is this business? And if it is healthy and established, why is it offering equity after so long? If their end goal is acquisition or IPO, any reason that it hasn't happened yet? Structural issues? Motivational? How much equity does the owner owe? Are the future recipients of this outstanding equity hankering to receive and sell it? Will that affect price? If there is a bunch of outstanding equity, how is it structured? Will it pose an issue to a potential acquirer? Is the offered equity of a different class than others and able to be priced differently for an acquirer or stock market?

"You are in a dangerous zone, my friend. $120k sounds like a lot of money, but it can go in a heartbeat. Protect your capital at all costs. Building something without validating your idea properly with the right customer discovery, finding problem / solution fit, and understanding the market is a recipe for failure to find the all-important Product / Market fit. I would suggest you take a breath, step back and look at some frameworks for innovation like Design Thinking, that puts an emphasis on the needs of the customer first by identifying the problem you are trying to solve, how to ideate and test your solutions, and to iterate with prototyping.

"registering IP can be helpful in establishing a baseline for long-term value creation but I'd try to save some money. Some legal firms can defer your fees until you raise a seed financing. You can also file a provisional for less money. similar for startup capital - you don't need 50k. You can incorporate a C corp in delaware for much less. Generally try to preserve cash, you may need it because getting 120k for no equity is very very unusual. Talk to customers / users. Have 50-100 customer conversations to make sure you understand the problem. Then pre-sell so that you know people want it and will pay for it... then build. This isn't universal advice because it depends on your business but talking to customer and pre-selling is generally a good approach.

"While I completely agree with your framework of what investors are looking for (we successfully raised both a 7 figure and an 8 figure round), what you're outlining largely should be covered in your combined deck + pitch. Institutional investors largely won't meet with you until they've had a chance to review at least a teaser deck, so having a well-presented first point of contact is helpful.

"The article is nice but skips over a very serious issue. It focuses on costs and why they're so high. That's fine, and the analysis is good. But it doesn't go deeply into revenue per user, which is the serious issue. Roblox focuses on children. It is a fun, creative, safe place for children to explore, play games, play online with their friends. In many countries, businesses have limits on how they can market and use customer data of minors. I have a law firm focusing on small businesses and each time I help someone start a business we spend a few months meeting regularly to discuss keys to success. One of those is metrics and one of the metrics we talk about is lifetime value of a customer (LTV). When you want to increase profits you typically have three knobs you can control: Costs/overhead, total sales, and profit margin. When we talk about total sales, you can either increase the number of people you sell to, which is what many startups seeking to be unicorns do, or you can increase the amount of money you make from each customer, which is a typical hallmark of a ""lifestyle business"" but frankly should be higher on the priority list of startups. Acquiring new customers is expensive, which is why people say growth is expensive. Increasing the LTV of a customer is a good strategy. But do players stick with Roblox as they turn 13? 🫤",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-08-19,u/newz2000,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1evmu2q/roblox_is_already_the_biggest_game_in_the_world/lit43or/,post: Roblox is already the biggest game in the world.

"[RoBlox made $2.7 billion last year](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/roblox-statistics/). It is reliably one of the most profitable games on Earth. &nbsp; > But I saw a stat showing that over the last 12 months it has averaged $138 in costs for every $100 in revenue. This just isn't true. Matthew Ball doesn't know the difference between ""profit I didn't make"" and ""profit I spent on further growth."" It's like those people who somehow think Amazon isn't making money. Making money and spending it all is not the same thing as not making money. Here, let's make it simple. Suppose you own a vending machine in a good location. It cost $100,000 to buy it and the land it's on. It costs $2000 to stock it, and sells out every day. When it sells out, you receive $4000. (I have no idea what numbers are realistic.) That means that every 50 days, you can buy another one, so you do. Somehow, your other locations make the exact same amount. So on day 75, you buy a third. On day 90-ish, you buy a fourth. On day 105-ish, a 5th. Around the end of a year, you have a fleet of 40 machines, and no standing profit. Are you breaking even or making lots of money? Matt thinks you're breaking even. I think that you have a massive and rapidly growing income. Three of the ten ""richest men on Earth"" are losing money every day, and some are ""poorer"" every year, according to Matt's viewpoint.

"1). Most players who play are kids and play for free. Signing up, and playing any game you want with your friends (without an email or phone number) is free. That’s why it’s so popular in the first place. 2). From a game development standpoint, it relies on kids making games for kids and more recently, adults making games for kids. There’s exploitation at almost every level of this. There are upsides but, the majority will never see that. 3). Scale. In order to scale with the current user base, you’d have to operate at a loss. It’s impossible to do so otherwise with the model they have. The only other way would be to charge accounts on creation like how Minecraft and others do it.

"Just at the math of it, bullmarket I would consider you guys at 10x next year's revenue multiple, so say around 10x 9M = 90M pre. If you want to raise 10-20M for 10-20% at 100M post sounds like a round to me. I will also caution of valuation overhang. I have been in seed investing in the past, and have seen companies get outbid by VCs who will keep upping the valuation just to get into your cap table.

"What is your CAC? 65% profit margin is exciting!!! $130 LTV is low if you have a options to increase this it will increase valuation. How long to churn? How big is your SAM?

"$100mm plus. Triple double double. Highly profitable. I’ve been in VC for 15 yrs. Anything less than $100mm would be because you’re choosing a lower valuation to get the investor you want. I’ve seen this pattern before in few home runs (of course some also fizzle out) — it’s more likely you’ll continue on your rocket ship trajectory than not, and it’s a great bet at $100mm.

For me to agree to be a technical co-founder the other founder needs to have a solid foundation in Sales, solid understanding of the segment the company is targeting and/or a solid network of investors.

"Building end to end is not that hard. I’ve done it all on my own. I also know the business side. The problem in this is one of several items. * nontechnical cofounders don’t know what they are doing. They tend to be price anchored. They tend to think that one developer is the same as any other developer, so they don’t get why they should trade 50% of the company, which is gonna be a decacorn in a couple of weeks, when they can get some cheap outsourced to build it. There is a reason why the cheap outsourced is cheap because typically, they can’t build a startup but that’s a different discussion. * most people can’t make decisions and don’t know how to hire.

"Are you concerned about them stealing your source code directly? Are you trying to protect your product from imitators by hiding your methodology and architecture? Stealing source code is considered unethical, if not illegal, everywhere. You can avoid that by vetting your vendors and hiring from legitimate sources. If you’re worried they might steal your ideas, you’re probably over-valuing your code. For most projects, it’s not hard to how the underlying code works by using the product. At worst, you could guess multiple viable methods to implement the project without knowing which this specific project used. Re-implementing the functionality in your product isn’t much easier just because they know the architecture you used. They’ll still run into roadblocks on the way based on the decisions they make.

"I disagree with a lot of the commentary here that late payroll is the biggest red flag. It's not a good look, but on its own doesn't mean to leave.

That said, opaqueness in finances is a HUGE red flag, and a reason I would not be there. A good startup leader shoudl be willing to talk to anyone in the company about runway (and prove it with actual numbers). Not just say ""We have runway"" with out sharing numbers.

"Yeah late payroll is not acceptable for any company, even startups. The founders as board members are personally liable for wages, and there’s big penalties too. That’s why, as messed up as startups are, you never see them letting work people unless they can pay salaries. Remember the SVB debacle and why all employees were about to be laid off. It’s because board members would have been personally liable for any unpaid wages. A day late can happen due to a bug, or a money transfer that’s late etc. But in that case you immediately wire the funds or cut a check, and then fix it later in Gusto. Employees have payments they need to make, or they get in trouble too. So it’s not acceptable, and you need to address it with the founders for their own protection. Maybe they’re right on cash and they’re waiting for a wire to hit. Best to be open about it so you can find a solution with them.

Payroll is one of those PITA things that has become so easy these days. It's one thing to be in a startup with everyone on board with a clear understanding that pay could be interrupted. If that's communicated up front and people still want to be a part of it, then it's on them. But if the expectation is that employees will be paid like, well, employees then interruptions are unacceptable.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-10-04,u/Proto-Plastik,https://reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1fvzfvi/pay_is_4d_late_when_do_i_stop_working/lqauk15/,post: Pay is 4d late; when do I stop working?

This is hard. I've been here before as well where the startup CEO dropped paying people for two weeks straight. It is completely demoralizing. Eventually we had a mini-mutiny and he came clean that we needed to deliver something to a client so we could get cash flow and pay everyone. We completed it and got our salaries paid back but the damage was done. I'd recommend looking for a new job to keep your options open at the very least. Payroll should be automated if you have gusto so this is a red flag. You can also talk to the CEO that they might need to address the company directly because you're hearing murmurings and people want to have a definite date when they should expect to be paid.

"What?! I have this argument daily with co-worker devs. And more than a few think this. I think they think this because they asked AI to do some specific proprietary code base solution and the first solution was wrong. ANd instead of providing more context AND getting clearer on the request, they simply decided AI = garbage. I find the exact opposite. Can AI produce garbage code?Absolutely. Just like any garbage human developer can. But if you use AI as the tool it is and provide it with the clear instructions and context any good developer requires to make the 'right' thing, AI is a SUPER tool for coding. If you look at the human as the 'client' and AI ast the 'developer', of COURSE AI is going to get stuff wrong when the 'client' doesn't provide all the details properly. Just think of how often you work with a client or manager that requests a 'simple' website/app from you. You build it to their specs only to realize they think it's ""wrong"" because they failed to give you ALL the specs. When you ask them why they failed to give you ALL the specs/requirement, they answer ""I thought it would be obvious since you're the developer.""

A lot of times it could be tough feedback to hear and it didn’t come in the form of a shit sandwich. Top CEOs don’t want the watered down feedback, that want the raw, unfiltered feedback to learn and grow. Huge difference between other top executives whom I was stepping on eggshells when giving feedback.

Self-awareness. It's absolutely mindboggling how often I see people who don't understand their strengths and weaknesses (I'd say even less than the top 10%). What others have said are also true: 1) Top founders tend to be wickedly smart... but the ones who are successful know where their weaknesses are and either learn or hire. 2) Top founders are diligent... but they understand where the time and effort needs to be spent 3) Top founders are experts in their field... but they also know that the business aspect is also crucial and are willing to delegate (and are able to hire experts) critical work.

"Reading this reminds me of something a mentor once told me: ""*The quickest way to get over imposter syndrome as a founder, is to really meet founders you think are successful*"" I guess you have a different experience, but the ""successful"" founders I've met: * Have strong opinions that are weakly held; meaning, regardless of their subject-matter expertise, they're willing to switch their opinion in a click; but I know tons that are the opposite * They project confidence, but internally are constantly insecure and seeking external validation for their hypotheses; yet I know tons of bull-headed believers * Some are customer-oriented, some don't care so long as clients pay * Some are afraid to fail, in fact, it's what keeps them awake at night * Some are okay-ish at building teams, and horrible maintaining them for long periods of time As founders, I get the impression that we're all our own worst critics on the startup hedonistic treadmill. We should all be investing time better, be raising more money, have a bigger vision, communicating better - the list goes on. Seeking external validation means that we ultimately end-up looking for what others've done, and falsely equivocating correlation with causation. Yet for every ""Musk worked 90h a week and succeeded"", there's a ""David Heinemeier Hansson valued personal-time, and also succeeded"". In fact, I'd bet that there is no ""*top 10% startup CEO trait""* that we could think of where we also couldn't point to a CEO who proved the opposite.

"Two important incentives drive VCs: 1. They don't know who's going to be successful, so it's in their interest to be interested in your startup.

Meanwhile, it's a shittier, mire expensive, less useful version of a solution that was solved ten years ago... and no reasonable person should have ever paid for that. 2. You can't get blood from a stone... your ROI for energy gets worse and worse as you get mental decision fatigue and physical exhaustion. No one gets my best work in hour 20... duh.

"I'm in the same boat, and I came to this realization after 2 years of extreme grind. I lost my social life and mental health only to build an app that no one is using. For me, growing up in the 2000s and seeing all the tech startup boom like Facebook & Twitter created a false expectation. I imagined myself creating the next big thing that's going to change the world when I grow up. In the early 2010s, when I was in the university, I was thinking of creating a cool startup with my friends, and we can be the next trendy app that ppl are going to talk about. In the late 2010s, I found my first job and decided to save my money for building an app to generate enough revenue so I could quit my 9-5 job instead of going on trips or buying an Alfa Romeo Guilia which I liked a lot at that time! Now, I wish to just have my friends around me and enjoy life experiences, and I spent some of my savings to finally get the car. If my startup works, that'd be great.

Do not invest any money until you have validated your idea. I put a lot of money and time into my first app and made exactly that mistake and failed miserably. It also was an app similar to some others so I thought it’s clearly going to work. I was wrong. True validation is getting paying customers (or signups) before you start coding. That way your chance for success rises tenfold. The best thing is this part usually doesnt cost any money and it will save you a lot of pain. The basic idea is to find the pain points of your target audience and see if it lines up with your idea. If it doesnt you iterate your concept until it’s better.

"Your first course of action should be to get a technical co-founder. If you are going to outsource development someone has to make decisions on framework, language, extensibility, supportability, backend infrastructure, connectivity with 3rd parties, and a lot more.

"You have the right approach in mind. Design a prototype, test it, build V1, test, setup lead generation and repeat with optimization and building new features. I've been building stuff for 10 years. The hard part is not the building of the software but the marketing and lead generation. This is where most fail. Regarding the build stuff... you can find a cofounder or two who will design and build it, assemble a team of freelancers or you can find a dev shop. Or mix. Benefit of an agency (if a good one) is that they will manage the tech side. Eg. If someone leaves they will find a replacement, vet it,... Benefit of freelancers is that you can pick directly the person who will work on the project. Benefit of a cofounder is that they have an aligned incentive. In all cases the downside can be poor colaboration, skill,... so do your research on them but interpersonal dynamics show up as you work and not realy before.

"Hi, as much as you’re confident I suggest you validate your idea beforehand with an MVP. Building an MVP can be much easier than you think, you can leverage low code tech stacks to put out an MVP within a month or two and start validating your idea before you transition to full code or add more features to it. About selecting someone, have a chat with them to understand how would they work and stuff, take suggestions, ask for possible challenges and certainly ask for some work experience first. Then use a platform like upwork to deal with them if you don’t trust them. Upwork is secure. Thought some freelancers might want to work directly, as I have worked with some clients where we directly work on a project with either set payments for milestones or on an hourly basis. Your current roadmap should look something like this but is not limited to: 1. Decide for what you want on your MVP. Mostly a few main features. 2. Get in touch with a freelancer or a team of freelancers for your MVP UI/UX in Figma. (I’m highly against agencies as I worked in one and they honestly charge you extra) 3. Talk to your developer and provide him the UI/UX to build your MVP upon. If you do decide to go with this MVP approach, I suggest using Bubble for a web app mvp and Flutterflow for a mobile app mvp. If you need more advice or want some insights, feel free to mention me again or reach out directly to me.

They deal with founders who are protective of their ideas all the time, don't take this the wrong way but they're not going to think your idea is special.

"The highest leverage you have is **the problem you try to solve**. There's a brilliant engineer who was inventing medical devices in his 20s. He built the Segway scooter and the Slingshot water purifier. But he has not figured this out. We've all experienced working at places that seem to be ..unprofessional. They make mistakes, left and right. But you're working for *them* because they picked a valuable, unsolved problem. A half-assed solution to a valuable problem is far more profitable than an ideal solution to an unvaluable problem. Find a problem that is: 1. Valuable 2. Not well solved. 3. People with the problem are willing to pay much more for than the cost. **Example** that seems to meet all 3. (Spoiler, it didn't) **Universal water purifier** : A device that purifies any water is valuable and now well solved, but nobody is willing to pay for it. If you're lucky you could get a non profit to pay for it. Read all about [Dean Kamen's Slingshot project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slingshot_(water_vapor_distillation_system)).

"I don't know Garry Tan nor have I heard him at any point. What I can say is that the communication style you describe is quite common in business, esp as you reach people in high level positions (corporate c-suite, politicians, etc). These people usually need to address a broad number of people, and they try to do their best to ""speak to everyone"", and not single any one out, or be offensive to one person or group. They also often times need to address very complex topics, and they don't have enough time to really dig into all the nuances, which most of the broader audience won't understand anyway.

A good salesperson can sell a product that doesn’t exist; it’s often not the product that is holding you back. Ours is crap right now, but we’ve sold the dream, and a few are coming along for the ride. A good salesperson will help with spotting PMF too. We are the same- ‘our product can have a use for everyone, everywhere!’ - which is like saying we aren’t going to look for PMF. Need to spot where the traction is and zone in on that. The next vertical (or horizontal) can wait until after we’ve built a foundation for the business.

"Yes, that is slow, that's how it works - B2B is an incredibly long way. I am in the middle of securing a big deal with a large bank (my first B2B customer), I managed to get an appointment with the CEO, demoed my product to him, he loved it, now we are in the middle of arranging everything and designing a customized version. By my estimates, we are 2-3 months away from signing a contract. So far I have spent enormous amount of time and money developing the product, reaching out to people, tweaking and demoing it, paying for everything I couldn't do myself out of my own pocket, sacrificing my profitable freelance work which I could have focused on instead and gained a decent amount of cash for in all those months without even trying. And I know that even when everything looks 90% done, I still have such a long way to go - it's about constantly keeping communication flowing without being too intrusive, going through the legal minutia, waiting many months just to get that one contact. And still, there is no guarantee that at the very last minute some board member or a seemingly tiny event wouldn't undermine the whole deal. Sometimes you just feel like giving up because there is so much responsibility and uncertainty. But I still love it, love the whole thing because it's my product, something absolutely unique I made using my own vision, seeing how I can help people and creating value.

"Nope - I’ve had both incredible and bad experiences working with folks on Fiverr. I’m currently working on a project with someone who I will probably hire full time they’re so good. Your first mistake was not getting more involved. You can ask for updates, and if you don’t get responses, complain. If things feel off, ask to cancel. I have always had good experiences with Fiverr customer support.

"Bill Gates is one of those super rare titans of industry who retired early after understanding that his wealth and power would better serve humanity in the non-profit world. Generally speaking, the non-profit industrial complex is a plague on humanity as very little money actually goes to the cause and instead pays exorbitant executive salaries.

"Perplexity AI Summary for the lazy: ### Title: DOJ Sues Visa for Alleged Monopoly in Debit Card Market * **Lawsuit Filed**: The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) has accused Visa of illegally monopolizing the debit card market. * **Market Control**: Visa processes over 60% of U.S. debit transactions, earning more than $7 billion annually in fees. * **Allegations**: The DOJ claims Visa forces businesses to use its network and stifles competition through exclusivity agreements and financial incentives for potential rivals. * **Consumer Impact**: Higher fees imposed by Visa lead to increased prices for consumers and reduced service quality. **Conclusion**: The lawsuit aims to promote competition in the debit card market, potentially lowering costs for consumers, though immediate changes may be minimal. ### Supplemental Research Summary Recent investigations indicate that antitrust actions against major corporations like Visa are part of a broader trend under the Biden administration, targeting monopolistic practices across various sectors. The DOJ’s lawsuit against Visa aligns with previous cases against companies like Ticketmaster and Google, emphasizing the administration’s commitment to fostering competition and addressing consumer harm caused by excessive fees. Experts suggest that while the lawsuit could lead to long-term benefits, immediate consumer impacts might be subtle, as savings may accumulate gradually across the economy rather than manifesting in noticeable price drops at checkout.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-09-25,u/BatPlack,https://reddit.com/r/business/comments/1fok3d9/us_justice_department_accuses_visa_of_illegal/lovycn4/,post: US Justice Department accuses Visa of illegal monopoly that adds to the price of ‘nearly everything’

With the high prices of this kind of gear — and a lot of the stuff at this retailer — it seems like someone could make a killing offering all of these returns as kits for activities and embracing the behavior instead of trying to make the old model fit the new behaviors.

"Food delivery was never a real business if human drivers were involved except in places like Asia where the income distribution is very widespread (ie very high income disparity). Here you can order food and pay a buck to have it delivered instead of spending 30 mins to go get it. Works well for those who earn high or western wages.

Second Boeing whistleblower dies after raising concerns about 737 MAX,,,,,,Anecdotal,post,,,,,,,,2024-05-05,u/Splenda,https://reddit.com/r/business/comments/1cksvu2/second_boeing_whistleblower_dies_after_raising/,subreddit: r/business | keyword: workaround
"He died of an infection, MRSA and influenza that grew into pneumonia. There is a connection but not as nefarious, certainly more cruel. The guy was super stressed due to the harassment and complications of being a whistleblower which weakened his immune system to the point that disease was able to take him out. The reason why we don't want to believe it is easy: because then we'd have to admit it's just as much our fault. We who do nothing to ask for whistleblower protections. Who allowed the prying and slandering of companies against whistleblowers because, well, it makes for juicy headlines we can throw comments on without ever reading the article. Who saw the sacrifice and cost of someone that made themselves unhireable to keep us safe, and then thought ""but I don't really want to pay more money, and scary stuff hasn't happened in a while so I guess it fixed itself?"" And then moved on until the next juicy article. Could it be that we're so out of touch and in denial of the dire situation we've built for ourselves? No, it must be whistleblowers who are wrong.

"Two thoughts. 1. Walmart isn't paying its retail employees enough to be walking snitches for a big box store. 2. ""Warding off shopper violence"" seems like a good cover for having a much closer tracker of employee productivity making it easier for Walmart to lay employees off who they deem are not working hard enough. Realistically are body cams going to reduce shopper violence? No. Because people already know there are cameras all over the store recording tens of angles on each aisle at least, what is a body cam going to change? And also more specifically, body cams where introduced in law enforcement to deter the cops wearing them, not to make civilians more behaved around the cops.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-12-17,u/Racer013,https://reddit.com/r/business/comments/1hgknvl/walmart_is_experimenting_with_body_cameras_for/m2k3xgc/,post: Walmart is experimenting with body cameras for employees—like the ones used by cops—to ward off 'unprecedented levels' of shopper violence

My coworker, who was an elderly man, was pushed onto the ground, because we were leaving after close and she wanted inside to get a drink before we left. One of my coworkers had a gun pulled on him after he asked a customer to wear a mask. All of these were committed by customers. These stories barely scratch the surface of what I’ve experienced.

"If I'm drinking one of the big three i prefer Miller Lite, so i had no dog in the ""boycott"". I think the whole Dylan Mulvaney controversy, while a marketing blunder, would have blown over relatively quickly on its own.

I think that kind of doubled down on the problem, and when they subsequently backpedaled on the whole thing they offended anyone from the lgbtq community they lost any goodwill they had there.

"All these companies are so full of shit. When we were coming out of the pandemic and had the logistical bottlenecks on imports entering the US transportation cost skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. In that time all of the companies that have any sort of supply chain (so all of them) had to start baking in the exorbitant transportation and warehousing costs. That was 2021 into 2022. A truckload from California to Pennsylvania went from on average about 5000 dollars up to name your price. 12,000 dollars was not unheard of at that time. So of course everyone had to now raise their prices as demand out reached supply. 2023 comes around and the prices begin crashing back down to reality, but as the companies began getting normal or even below normal rates for logistics, do you think any of them wanted to roll back prices? No, not a bit not even a faint gesture of correction for the consumers. 2024 logistic rates are back to pre-pandemic levels and we aren’t seeing any savings at the stores.

CA fucked over all the small growers and created a market only the rich could get into legally so they went back to what they knew. Plus these legal places started killing the price they pay per lb and the street price for quality stuff remained roughly the same while street prices are significantly lower than store prices.

Yes make a career decision based on one outlier that pays above average.

"Lmao… r/ business is a joke… Elon Musk didn’t buy Twitter with the goal of making a profit. I often see people saying Musk is an idiot for buying Twitter for 44 billion. That he has no chance of making that money back and making it profitable enough to be a worthwhile business venture. But I think he knew that when he bought it. Musk bought Twitter for power and influence. As we move forward the balance of power in geo-politics will morph into something we haven’t seen before. There will still be superpowers, most likely USA and China along with a bunch of balancing powers - India, Europe etc. But there will be another player in the field too. That player will be the Tech industry. The tech industry will have the ability to control who is in charge of the super powers because they control what news the public is allowed and not allowed access to. This will mean world leaders have to keep tech bosses happy to remain in power. Musk wants to be one of those people. It’s now him who decides if Donald Trump has a platform on Twitter. It’s him who controls the algorithm that decides which news articles Twitter users are allowed to see. He has enough money. When you’re the heir of a South African diamond mine owner, you don’t see money the same way. He’s never had to worry about losing his job and not be able to feed his family like the rest of us. He’s never had to make the decision between taking a job for a low pay right now or taking on a college debt in the hope of making a bigger income later in life. These concerns of the average person are irrelevant to him. When money comes easy, you need other things to strive for. In Musk’s case it is power. Thats the reason he bought Twitter. Obviously he’d prefer it to be profitable, but if it isn’t, he’s still bought what he wanted.",,,,,,Anecdotal,comment,,,,,,,,2024-09-03,u/perch34,https://reddit.com/r/business/comments/1f85voo/musks_twitter_investors_have_lost_billions_in/llcdpxz/,post: Musk’s Twitter investors have lost billions in value

Even small things like the cost of the cheese, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, etc all went up 30%. Even the beer is up 50-60% (we were paying $80-85/half bbl for Bud Lite and such, that's now $130). Beer and beef alone is way over our food cost that we used to have on that burger when we sold it for $10.

"Rising sea levels, biodiversity collapse, extreme weather—these are the grisly horsemen of climate apocalypse. But don’t forget the fretting loan officers. [A study published earlier this year](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927539823001123) found that US mortgage approvals tend to dip following periods of hotter-than-normal weather. For every 1 degree Celsius that temperatures rise above average, approvals fell by nearly 1 percent—and their value by more than 6.5 percent. Lower consumer demand was only part of the problem, according to the study’s authors. The effect was mostly down to loan officers’ worries about climate change and what it might mean for the assets they were lending against. In other words, climate change was devaluing property before their very eyes.

"**To Cut a Long Story Short:** This document emphasizes the importance of minimizing cognitive load in software development to reduce confusion and enhance code maintainability. It distinguishes between intrinsic cognitive load, inherent to the task's complexity, and extraneous cognitive load, introduced by the way information is presented. The text provides practical examples of how to reduce extraneous cognitive load, such as simplifying complex conditionals by using intermediate variables with meaningful names, favoring early returns over nested if statements to focus on the main logic path, and preferring composition over inheritance to avoid deep and confusing class hierarchies. It also discusses the drawbacks of having too many small, shallow modules or microservices, which can complicate understanding due to numerous interactions, advocating instead for deeper modules with simple interfaces that encapsulate complexity effectively. The document underscores the significance of information hiding and cautions against over-reliance on frameworks, which may evolve independently and add unnecessary complexity over time.
